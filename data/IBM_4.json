Project managers or engineers might think about the number of communication channels, which is n(n-1)/2 where n = number of stakeholders (Ref: PMBOK, 3rd ed.). For 330,000 employees, that means IBM has 54.4 billion communication channels. Obviously that is difficult to manage and work within. Recognizing that there is an inherent challenge in th\u2026\u00a0e liquidity of knowledge and information can help employees find ways to solve those problems, such as developing wikis for small teams. The other downside to having that many employees means that every time the company spends $3 on each employee, you just spent $1 million. Many employees don't understand this problem, and instead complain about only receiving free ice cream in the cafeteria after project milestone is reached when their cousin at the unprofitable, but well funded, start-up is getting free coffee and soda every day.",
        "advice": "Every IBMer operates to varying degrees baed on your position in one of three roles--doing, leading, and managing. For instance, a staff engineer will spend the majority of their time doing, and a small percentage leading or managing. Whereas, senior managers will spend almost all of their time leading, some managing, and almost none of their time doing (as it should be since they are the strategic leaders of the com\u2026\u00a0pany). First-line managers have the toughest jobs in the company, however, since they are stretched the farthest in all three roles. Therefore, I would recommend that senior management look for ways to offload the \"doing\" role from first-line managers so that they can focus on leading and managing their teams. By doing so, first-line managers can spend more time developing employees, looking for ways to get the best out of each employee (do not read \"most time out of each employee\", instead read \"best\"), or recognizing when an employee would be a better fit in a different team, organization, or even company.Also, I would recommend that first-line and second-line managers cultivate a culture of allowing employees to try new ideas and new ways of working. I'm not saying that this isn't already happening or isn't being encouraged to some degree because it is, I just believe that managers need to do a better job at this. For instance, if employees have an idea to work better but it requires a website or computing power, as a manager don't say \"that's not allowed by our IT department for security purposes\" or \"a new version of the w3 intranet wiki is being rolled out shortly\" or my personal favorite (read: the one I rely despise) is \"we've always done it this way.\" Instead look for ways to enable your employees to succeed. Remember, everyone at IBM was hired for a reason--someone saw that they had the knowledge and drive to be an IBMer, so take a chance and let the employees implement their best ideas, even the ones you as a manager think will fail (but use a little commonsense here). Oh and for all those IBMers who say \"we've always done it this way\", I would encourage you to go join the team designing the computing, tabulating, and recording equipment. Oh wait, what's that? You say that group doesn't exist anymore. My point exactly.",
        "pros": "For a large company with over 330,000 employees, IBM does many things right as an employer. They pay competitively and have a solid benefits package. They have a great internal training program for things like management and project management. They delegate much of the human resources (HR) responsibilities to the first-line managers, so that key HR decisions are being made by those with the most knowledge about the \u2026\u00a0employee instead of by HR representatives who couldn't pick the employee out of a line-up. They have a strong mentoring program (people who say they don't have a strong mentoring program probably weren't willing to put in the effort and time necessary to make those mentoring relationships fruitful).

If you have a new idea, or process, you have to move heaven and earth to get it implemented. Management can also promote on who you know, \u2026\u00a0not what you know.

So much so, that sometimes you get so used to having so many resources that you become a little spoiled. There is a depar\u2026\u00a0tment or a person for every possible business, sales, or service function. The benefits are also world class.
