        "cons": "There is an unhealthy influence from management to do whatever is neccesary to \"get the job done\" which prevents a clear distinction between work and personal time. This wouldn't be such a problem if they were more flexible with salespeople working from home. The pressure on the sales staff is average most of the time, however, pressure increases exponentially during the end of fiscal quarters or due to turn-over rel\u2026\u00a0ated issues.",

It would also be helpful if senior management would fully outline the expected hallmarks for career advancement and then stick to them....",
