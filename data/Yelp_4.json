I was an Account Exec for SeatMe/Yelp Reservations. It was definitely difficult at times doing phone sales but it helps having an awesome team around and a management team that was invested in me being successful. .",

        "cons": "Pay is very bad. Definitely can't afford to live in the city you work in if you're doing this gig. 40 to start.Unfortunately none of the pros are enough to make up for the crushing boredom that eventually sets in with moderating content. It gets tough reading poorly punctuated block paragraphs written by racist, angry people all day.They tell you straight up when you start not to really expect this to\u2026\u00a0 go anywhere. It's kinda sad since we have a lot of talented, intelligent people on the team wasting their smarts. They could do more to prevent turnover and have a more stable long term workforce.In our particular department there is a lot of forced fun that really gets irritating. It's a bit tone deaf since they actually advertise the position as being for introverts. Then they do things like cliche team building exercises, scavenger hunt running around the office, trivia, assigned seats to force mingling at lunch. There's lots of guilt tripping about participating. There have been plenty of times where they've deliberately withheld details about an event to try to get more people to show up, and then force participation of some activity on them. It's stressful, childish and often feels like I'm back in school.And maybe you'll think this is a pro, but they recently instituted music on Friday afternoons and it is the worst. I've never worked in a professional office environment where music has been played, so it seems especially out of place in our otherwise very quiet space. This isn't sales.There are a lot of management changes lately that make the job really stressful. There are a lot of bad personalities in the department.No one seems to be on the same page about anything. The communication is ridiculous. You can be doing something wrong for months due to a misunderstanding. It's a mess. I'm looking to move on.",
        "advice": "If you don't expect much out of the team, you won't get much. You're always hiring way too many people for the job and scrambling to find things for us to do. Why not provide more incentives for increased performance, make your employees feel valued so they stick around and have a smaller, longer-term more experienced workforce. I think most of us would be willing to take on overtime when it was called for. That has \u2026\u00a0to be cheaper than training and providing full benefits to constant unnecessary hires.",

I do that somewhat regularly here.Flexible Hours with the option to wor\u2026\u00a0k from home when necessary.Sweet health benefits and they're pretty generous with stock even for us lowly user ops workers.Average good-ish time off/sick time",
