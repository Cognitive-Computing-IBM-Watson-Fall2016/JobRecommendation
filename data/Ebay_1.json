        "cons": "eBay provides a dysfunctional, passive-aggressive work environment, where people are very uncomfortable giving and getting feedback. Many employees are not very good at their jobs but they don't seem to care about improving themselves, and they aren't given the information that would help them do so. They come to work to progress their own careers by doing visible internal projects, rather than focusing on real custo\u2026\u00a0mer-facing projects. And they are rewarded for this!There's a general lack of knowledge and curiosity about new and developing technologies, and most of the company seems to be stuck on doing things the old way. If it worked so well before, so why change? And these are the people responsible for creating and improving new products for customers. They don't know about technology and don't seem to care.New employees are often treated as completely inexperienced, even if they've worked in the industry for years. If you don't have any eBay work experience, you apparently don't know what's going on in the world.The focus on work-life balance is a plus, but it's also a minus. There is actually too much focus on preserving one's non-work life, to the extent that work is not really made rewarding and meaningful.Many people responsible for making decisions on the lower-levels of things seem to be rather indecisive, especially in the middle of major changes going on. Decisions are made and reversed so often, that the original intent of them is lost entirely. Long-term goals are rare or completely non-existent, because apparently it's only important to worry about the next few months.Internal processes are heavy and bloated, and there are so many steps to go through and varying tools to use, that a lot of time is wasted on administrative details. Larger companies are not known for being quick to react, but this is ridiculous.",

Several long time employees either quit or were fired due to eBay's ridiculous productivity metrics. Several supervisors gave me empty promises and false hopes of providing training to help get promoted during my years of employment. Couldn't clock in more than 5 minutes early or 5 minutes late without receiving a hit on attendance.Some employees had to share desks. No roaming profiles on PCs. If you moved to a different location, your PC would not come with you so you'd have to setup all over from scratch, like a new employee (and moving to new desks was quite frequent). Very limited user account on PCs. Very poor annual raises. Only get one floating holiday. eBay upper management is out of touch with customers and front line employees.No opportunity to gain skills you could use at other jobs - you use internal tools which are useless when changing jobs. The help line was rarely helpful. When eBay missed Wall Street goals for the first time, regular employees did not get a bonus, but the CEO (Meg Whitman at the time) received a one million dollar bonus.",
        "advice": "Realize that front line employees are people too, not robots. Front line employees are in direct contact with thousands of customers daily; customers who often times determine their continued use of the site based on the customer service they receive. Stop outsourcing to foreign countries! Start caring about quality service! Bring back what eBay used to be. Management has lost sight of what really matters - eBay user\u2026\u00a0s.",
        "pros": "Good medical benefits package (in 2006). On site gym. Unlimited free drinks from vending machines. Dual LCD monitors at every workstation, telecommuting available with company provided laptop. Very good Herman Miller chairs for every employee in the office. Close proximity to freeway interchange in Draper. My coworkers were great to work with (not any supervisors or team leads though).Until my position was ou\u2026\u00a0tsourced (in 2004), they were a company I was proud to say I worked for. I would even wear company attire. They provided use of Macro Express which was very helpful in providing \"personal\" canned responses. The Supervisors and Team Leads had frequent off site lunch \"meetings\" which is great if you're a Supervisor or Team Lead. Quarterly profit sharing bonuses based on performance if Wall Street goals are met or exceeded. Dedicated phone rooms for local calls. Decent sized break rooms with big screen TVs. Several dedicated meeting rooms. No cubicles (instead \"lasagna\" type seating). You get a 1 month sabbatical after 5 years of employment - if you can last there that long (I came up about a year short).",

Many are independent people who \u2026\u00a0don't like a lot of rules and structured work environments. Part of eBay's attraction for sellers was the ability to define their own work. Your sellers have a wealth of experience ranging from simple, occasional sellers to highly educated and accomplished businessmen, so stop trying to make a one size box to fit all, it will never fly.Not everyone wants to be a power seller.Your buyers are1) looking for a bargain : Those looking for a bargain will find it online. Please don't make selling on eBay so expensive and complex that the sellers cannot compete with other online sources. Free shipping is fine, but everyone understands that there is nothing free about it.2) looking for a collectible item: Those looking for a collectible know the going price of that item, they are the experts. The truly unique one of a kind items will find their own price point. Those items will always attract interest and business. Don't make eBay a gigantic store with no place for the rare items that energize the community and capture attention, remember our roots.3) looking for something they can't find elsewhere: The flea market is an essential part of the eBay experience. Please don't let your perceptions of what is worthwhile color the marketplace.4) looking for a simple, safe shopping experience: Please don't try to predict what people are trying to find and how they will use it when they shop on eBay. It would be better to teach people how to search than force them into search patterns based on corporate perceptions.Do not forget eBay's community values.Please remember the more rules you make, the more time and money you have to spend on enforcement.",
