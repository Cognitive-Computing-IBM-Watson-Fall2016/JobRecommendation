Co. emphasis on work life balance is, in practice, a joke - they'll work you to death and call it a normal part of the job.Co. is ovverly reliant on the whole \"you need to manage your own career\" mantra.

Since this is a soft skill MS places too little value on it - but boy, do they miss the mark here- it has everything to do with the all important bottom line. Again, lip service by upper management on how vital it is but in the trenches it's shocking how far people can climb without knowing how to manage people- to communicate with their workers..Notoriously bad at not seeing the big picture when it comes to internal ops or long term impacts to customer sets - would rather throw something on the wall (read spend $) to see if it sticks then to step back and study the situation before acting. If MS were a small company without such deep pockets they would have bankrupted themselves years ago doing this. Shockingly little sense of ROI.Politics, cliques, favoritism all rampant and slow the company's output, productivity and employee sat more than management cares to admitFar too much lip service to wanting to change and improve and no consistent will to do it.Since MS has made working there an almost strictly business proposition that's what I've done in self-defense. I'm my own business (I may work for MS but handle my career strictly in how it benefits me and not the co.) and like so many before me I'm looking to leave (despite the econonomy).

This \"Not Invented Here\" attitude impedes creative thinking.2) The performance rating system is seriously flawed--a substantial (25%) amount of your time is spent doing low-value tasks indirectly related to your job. These tasks are injected into your \u2026\u00a0performance plan so your manager has a way to measure you and compare you to others.3) **YOUR YEARLY PERFORMANCE RATING IS DETERMINED FIRST AND THEN YOU'RE INFORMED--there's no way to change a bad/erroneous review**.4) The employee calibration system forces your manager to put 10% of her team in the \"below standard\" level, meaning you're not going to be promoted for at least a year OR you're going to be \"managed out\" (fired) even if you've achieved the goals you and your manager set down in writing at the beginning of the year. This \"stack-ranking\" system into 20%-70%-10% brackets determines your the \"contribution margin\" and is based on managers' discussions, hearsay, and perceived age (discrimination). It affects how much stock--a form of deferred compensation--you get that year. Again, you have no way of changing your standing--it's all decided behind tightly-closed doors.5) It's fairly hard to change jobs--you can't interview without your manager's permission unless you've been in role 18 months. Many postings are dummy postings because a candidate's already been selected and the hiring manager has to go through the process. And most of the jobs are so specific that it's hard to jump across organizations unless you can get an insider to recommend you.6) Cost-cutting has had a negative impact on every aspect of the Company, and it's nearly impossible to get business travel approval unless you're in sales or consulting.7) For a technology company, there's far too much management overhead and this leads to slow decision-making. Very few people here are willing to stand up and to make a decision or to go out on a limb to support their position.8) Microsoft is an extremely matrixed organization and that reality often impedes your ability to get things done rapidly.9) There are few \"people managers\" at Microsoft. At levels below General Manager, \"managers\" have a **regular workload** in addition to their people management responsibilities, and this is when people management is most important and valued. At the GM level and above, it's about headcount, not individuals.10) In the U.S., the HR department offers very little career development support and no individual assistance. You're supposed to work through your manager, who may or may not know anything.11) Promotions are handed out based on excellence in your current role, budget, and business need. So, even if you've been the top performer on your team and have done everything just right, you may be stuck. Thnis is why many people leave Microsoft.12) It's very unusual to get a promotion when you get a new job--that's why they're called \"internal transfers\".",

I often work 75+ hours a week in order to complete all the works. Not only me but I also hear complaints from colleagues in the same team about the workload. The workload comes in the following ways:\u2026\u00a01. Scheduling: the management will try to \"persuade\" you to compress the schedule into what fits their schedule needs, ignoring the true task time costs, and all the uncertain factors that could delay the schedule. Once you sign on that schedule, all factors that drag you down need to be paid from your own pocket -- your personal time. By forcing you to commit to such scheduling, they implicitly put you to work long hours.2. On-demand tasks: when you are signed on to work on a 1 month long project that needs 8 hours dedicated time each day, the management will try to randomly give instruction to you to take care of some random tasks, which could take 3 hours a day. At the same time they track your progress on the scheduled task.3. Incidents: you need to take care of incidents, such as cluster down or test reported failures. Which could take 4 hours for each incident. At the time you signed-up to work on a 8 hours-day pre-planned project.4. You can get promoted only if you work extra time: the management will assign you with all those routine tasks that would already take you 10+ hours a day. For promotion, as they said, you need to do something beyond routine that would impress them. That means you find another project besides your already long hours routine tasks, to get recognized.5. Code changes everywhere: as the Cloud related project is fast growing, all the components were changing, and your existing code can be broken by other people anytime. Then you need to take care of that.Besides the workload, also there is issue in:1. No core competency developed in SDET job role: even with such long hours daily working time, most things I do are low level: writing straght-forward-logic C# code (like scripts), take care of some config text files, copy-paste test failures' stack traces, start test runs, spend 5 hours to find out a way to hack the dev component to test something they didn't provide interface. I believe I won't be able to find another job after doing things like for 3 more years.2. The pay scale is definitely not worthy for this workload. I of heard people in Amazon complaining their workload due to nature of online services (fast pace, incidents, etc), but their pay is 30% higher.
