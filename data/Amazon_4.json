What this means is that a lousy service will take your free time and interrupt your sleep one week out of 6-8. This would be as expected for a lot of things, but some services are naturally chatty (external systems, upstreams that file a pageable ticket to find out why yo\u2026\u00a0ur service is acting up, etc.). In addition, the workload can be high if you find yourself in the wrong place - choose wisely.The downside of free reign with teams is that there is often little consistency of behavior, as each team implements what it needs; this can cause problems if you need something not offered. It also impacts crosscutting concerns - coordinating multiple teams is almost impossible.Payments is a high stress area, as is anything that supports warehouses. Having been in payments, it's getting better, but I didn't get along with one or two of the managers; I got a bit burnt out, then was denied vacation that I desperately needed and tossed on a deathmarch project., so that colors my views a bitAmazon has cheap benefits (frugality is the watchword, but it burns a bit when the most significant bennie is a bus pass).

How often doyou get paged? What kind of schedule does this position require (45hour weeks? 60+ hour weeks?)? When was the last time you worked aweekend when you weren't on call? How much legacy/technical debt isthe team responsible for? And probably the most important question ofall you have to ask yourself: is this team solving problems that areinteresting to me? The teams that aren't are teams you will never behappy at, no matter what the rest of the environment is like.The final tidbit that does somewhat makeup for some of the less\"optimal\" teams: Amazon has a policy where anyone can change positionsafter they've been in their current position for a year (provided youdon't get a negative review).

        "cons": "I choose corporate housing and it turns out to be a huge amount of taxable income (albeit non-cash) on the W2. Called back HR and she wouldn't give detailed breakdown. The benefits appeared great to intern but the taxing is huge! (I have other income as a grad student so the benefits turn out to be costly).",
