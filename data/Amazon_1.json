        "cons": "Amazon does not value its employees and this severely affects every aspect of worklife. Employees are treated as replaceable, renewable resources, not as members of a working team to grow with the company. The focus is on new hiring with the expectation that any semi-intelligent employee will leave within the first two years.New hire salary is incremented at well over 2x the rate that top members of a team ar\u2026\u00a0e given raises. New folks regularly make 5-10K more than their tech leads who are the highest contributors on the team, breeding poor sentiment. Promotions are easily promised during crunch times requiring 100-hr work weeks and just as easily forgotten when promotion or bonus time actually does come around. Additional responsibility, both in person and in project management, are regularly compounded upon top contributors without promoting individuals to the authority such a position requires, making it difficult to get things done in a culture where cross-team cooperation is like pulling teeth.In terms of quality of work, there is no value given to developer time and no emphasis on the importance of infrastructure. Build tools are down daily and ownership is a lost concept. Scapegoating is a regular occurrence when site-wide post-mortems require heads to roll. Few things are properly documented, rarely anything is QA'ed, and as all original product engineers tend to leave within two years, nearly everything is a legacy application. The product-development lifecycle emphasizes pushing new features/products out quickly, leaving little or no time for QA cycles. The same engineers who coded the features under crunch are sometimes asked to do QA sign-off. Yet when they come back to management with lists of blocking/non-blocking bugs, they are asked to hide the lists and just to provide the sign-off. The result ends up being shoddy services held up by a company of already-overworked engineers serving constant on-call rotations who know they will be paged, but even knowing this are rarely able to figure out how to even begin debugging the systems.When I joined, every single person on the previous generation of my team had left. I later discovered that this was a regular occurrence which had already happened for the third time. All the great projects and career opportunities I had been sold on before joining were back-burner items reserved for interns and other people they had yet to sell a permanent position to. Regular employees were delegated to continuous on-call rotations for applications no one knew anything about and left to debugging bugs hardcoded years before. The overwork, stress, and lack of self-fulfillment created quite the back-stabbing team. In my first week as a new hire, I was angrily told by my mentor \"Every time I sit down to get something done, you ask me a question.\" Later the same day, I was told by my manager \"So I've talked to the team and they say you never talk to them or make use of their expertise ~ you simply putter in a stuck corner when you could just ask.\"As my time there progressed, I regularly discussed the lack of opportunities and the disparity between my expected and actual roles with my manager, who always promised clear action items to address my concerns ~ none of which ever happened. When I found a new team where I thought I could make a greater impact, my manager blocked my transfer, going all the way through HR to accuse of poaching.

Probably due to the fact that I was young and naive, and believed that more good work I produce, faster I would would get promoted and receive raises.

They gave me a 1.5% raise after 1 year, citing that promotions and raises are not norm\u2026\u00a0ally dished out to people who has been their for more than 1.5 years. The max raise was 3% annually, which was only 6 months after my last review period (which was discarded because I was too \"young\" in the company). So despite the highest performance rating on the scale, I received a prorated 1.5% raise.I was the engineer primarily responsible for launching a new store in the company. 5 days of almost zero sleep in the war room. Before the launch, my manager promised extra vacation for me to unwind, big raises and promotions. After launch, I barely saw the guy anymore. I quit soon afterwards. Then I found out the guy was trying hard to climb into the director seat. Which he did.While I received no pad on the back, no raise, no promotion, no extra vacations, the VPs all recieved a 2 million cash bonus, and directors 1 million. The only recognition I received was a $1.50 coffee purchased by my VP after 3rd night straight in the war room.When I played a small part in accidentally revealed project on the main site, which received wide press coverage. (Many other played a bigger part). I was the only one to own up to my mistake. Therefore, I was single handly scapegoated for the incident. I was not allowed to defend myself in front of the post-modem committee, because management deemed 3 hours out of my time would jeopardize the project. So they wrote something in my place admitting guilt.When I was leaving, I was appointment manager of two new hires.

There are a *lot* of reasons I'd recommend not working here; but the two that stand out are the culture and the hours. You will work a lot of hours in whatever dept. you're in, almost without exception. But the real overriding factor in everything that makes it suc\u2026\u00a0h a horrible place to work - the one that all the other issues grow from - is its culture.Here's the long and short of it: front-line and middle managers here are really the 'bottom of the barrel' types. No self-respecting manager would try to manage any team in this environment (unless they didn't know anything about it when they were hired - ahem!), and that's because of one corporate-mandated policy that destroys any possibility of teamwork: Top Grading. Let me explain...Top Grading sounds like a good idea when you only look at the 'top' part. What that means is the top 10% of performers on each team get the bulk (or all) of the raises for that team that year. This happens every year (depending on your dept., anywhere from Feb.-May), and is something so pervasive in the company that you really do risk your job if you try to stand up against it (pretty much Bezos's idea - so if your chain answers up to a Sr. VP that answers to him, it's gonna happen).But why stand against it? Well, let's say you have a great team, and everyone's pulling their weight. The problem with this policy is, it also includes what some have called Bottom Grading - appropriately named, as it spells out the rest of the truth of the happily named Top Grading. The full truth is, you have to get rid of the bottom 10% of your team every year - period, end of story, no arguments. Basically, Amazon's 'high bar' with 'bar raisers' in interview loops comes down to little more than an inflexible ideology.So just try and make a team in that kind of environment! Even just trying to be part of one is horrific; after all, you could be next. It's either you or someone else on your team - probably a couple or more. And this includes managers and directors.I'm betting you can guess the result: a highly politicized environment, where everyone's going for the immediate win and doing their best to suck up to their boss at every moment, as once you're clued in, you realize your manager's or director's hands are tied. You walk on glass, and try not to *ever* cross them or give them a reason to put your name in the bottom 10%.So that's it, in a nutshell - ideology 'tinkled down' from above loses to allowing managers to manage their own teams independently. Which pretty much explains why no competent managers would stay there, and why I left. And also why their attrition rate is horrible - 10% must go, combined with no healthy team dynamics whatsoever. It's just a real disaster over there.",
        "advice": "Stand up to the policy of Top Grading, plain and simple. Let upper management - and especially Jeff Bezos and HR - know that you're the one who's best for judging your team's performance, as a group or as individuals. Get rid of that, and I guarantee you the attrition of smart talent will disappear almost overnight.",

Expect to be working on your self-review from mid-January to early-March, plus you'll have to do an upward review of your manager (watch out--if you give your manager a poor review, expect to have retaliation), and at least 3-10 peer reviews!Please allow a work/life balance, it is seriously lacking.",

Next the number of not-so-great internal customers and crummy co-workers overbalance that of the good ones.

Next there is a much larger group that floats along, doing passable work and maintaini\u2026\u00a0g relationships to stay in place. Then there is a small number of \"chosen\" few, those who benefit from their managers favor with decent hours expected for work and favoritism for advancement. So those doing the majority of work are in the minority.Another big issue comes up when reviews come around and a single digit percent of the population is to be managed out. This can have to do with performance, but it can also be that your manager just likes someone else better. To bad, but Amazon has to \"keep raising the bar.\" The average employee may get a small increase and a little bit of stock. Those with favor from the boss get a nice batch of RSUs and cash, too, as a bonus (Dont let them tell you theres no cash bonus - its there just for a few). Just remember that if you are getting an offer from Amazon know that they will try to shill you coming in the door and screw you while you are there, So dont take the first offer. Make sure to get as much stock and base as you can because you will not see much of an increase over time, nor much additional stock grants even if you do a great job.Then there are the managers and mid-level leadership. When I joined Amazon there was a good size population of good, even great, managers. Those who wanted to help those around them succeed. Over time these people have left, only to be replaced by the average Amazon manager. This person does not care about you. He cares about his bonus (see above). He wants his manager to be happy and show the love. You are just a way for him to benefit. This deportment of a manager is not uncommon; its anywhere. Its just that the bad actors have an added fuel of the Amazonian attitude.The Amazonian attitude is a cocky, I'm-so-much-more-smarter-than-you, obnoxious, the world owes me attitude. Kind of like a smart mouthy kid who takes the ball home when he doesnt get his way. A majority of the managers at place really have this aura, as do many many others. The place reeks of this cocky snarkyness. And you'll be that way, too, if you work there. It creeps in and takes over. You might not know its there until your spouse tells you so. Then again you are smarter then your spouse! Ha! They couldnt get a job at Amazon!! You might not know you have the attitude until after you leave the company. Then its a hangover when you go to your next company. Amazon thrives on a culture of argument. You want to win? Better have good metrics and a stomach for confrontation. If you cannot argue well you will be eaten for lunch. At any and all levels across the company. That attituide doesnt work in the real world where you coorperate with your peers and co-workers, say please and thank you, are polite. Try some of that argumentive agressive manner with yor new company and it will be noticed in a negative light.And then there is Amazon HR and recruiting. Amazon was at one time a great place to go to work and prove oneself. If you could make it there you showed to the world that you had great skills. Thats no longer the case. The team has grown huge and the bar for competency has dropped. The lower it goes, the more recruiters they hire. And the bar drops again. The chosen few I spoke of above is really the case in HR and recruiting. Sad, but true. Win your managers favor and you'll go far.In sum my opinion is that Amazon is not a classy company. That venier of friendliness to the outside world hides the crass, boorish behaviors within the company. Want to work there, great! Yes, if you want to you can bring your dog to work, and/or dress like a street person. Just know theres a price to pay for the opportunity.",
        "advice": "Having a high turnover rate should alarm you. You are not raising your bar with ejecting a yearly set percentage of your staff. Especially since the replacements hired are like the interviewers and hiring managers: Average. Should be a clue, too, that to grow the staff you end up relocating so many people to work at Amazon. this due to a large number of Seattle locals do not want work at Amazon due to the poor reputa\u2026\u00a0tion and those former Amazonians who refuse to go back.",

        "cons": "See review titled \"Please understand what you are getting into\"The above review is spot on. The average Area Manager's total compensation package is $100+k/year. Take that number, divide it by 60-65 hrs average off-peak work week and 80-85 hrs average peak work week and be astonished at the hourly rate of pay. Yeah, that is why most managers never do that exact thing. The company is growing so quickly, they recru\u2026\u00a0it recent college graduates. I have nothing against college graduates, an AM has to be one, but an experienced manager is now expected to guide 200 hourly associates and teach \"green\" managers how to manage. Throw in high production standards and other high stress factors and your head will spin. Amazon rarely gives yearly base pay raises which even begin to keep up with cost of living increases - they issue stock instead. I was the top performing manager at our FC and received a 1% pay increase. Interested in a promotion? Get in line behind the \"Pathways\" managers. These folks, regardless of performance, will be promoted or placed in the path of least resistance. Some were very good, but many more could not handle the daily stress of the shift. Out of the original 23 managers hired for the start-up, only 3 remain with the company as of this posting. We were to open the FC with 50+ managers, our first peak consisted of 31 managers, leaving those 31 to pick-up the hours of the missing 19. Please don't let the dollar signs dictate your decision.

It is not uncommon for employees with little aptitude or relevant experience to be promoted based on politics. They often make poor managers and contribute to negative employee morale. I've seen wonderful & talented employees ignored in favour of less competent counterpa\u2026\u00a0rts, due to nonsensical personal politics wielded by snr management. Without exception, they all have walked away & into much better jobs. Amazon find it hard to keep talent, & when they get talent they dont seem to know how to leverage it.- The Amazon value of \"frugality\" is in theory a good one, however the way in which it's leveraged within the organisation, leaves many employees feeling used and abused. The constant pinching over basic expenses, door desks, computer equipment etc results in employees feeling demotivated and uninvested in the company.- Type A micromanagement. Everything from MBA managers telling you how to write an email or telling you how to do the job you've been doing for the last 15 years - a job in they haven't done. There is a pervasive sense from snr management, that they are 'superior beings' and this grates, particularly if you find them to be ineffective. There can be lots of focus on face time & clock watching. I was based in HQ (not in a distribution centre) but it felt like I was working a shift job where I had to punch in & punch out. If I was 15 mins late they would want me to stay 15 mins more at the end of the day.- Incredibly high employee churn. This is for a multitude of reasons: lack of work life balance; Type A culture of micromanagement; 'frugality' & poor people management in which unethical politics pervades. The company bleeds talent constantly, but there doesn't appear to be an interest in addressing the issue of churn - in my team, snr management stopped telling the team when a coworker had resigned, because to do so would possibly mean having to address the underlying & aforementioned issues of why employees leave.",

Encourage managers \u2026\u00a0to hire from within, even if someone lacks the 10 out 10 bullet points on qualifications.

They won't excuse an absence due to illness without penalizing you in their ridiculous attendance \"point\" system. They wouldn't exempt me from mandatory overtime for an important appointment that was scheduled weeks before said overtime was even mentioned, nor would they give an exemption for something as personally significant as attending my brother's wedding! They just said, \"oh, you'll have to take a hit on your attendance.\" Gosh, thanks! I guess they don't expect associates to have a life outside of the warehouse when they schedule 60-hour work weeks with no exceptions, saying, \"come in to work, or else,\" and then inexplicably send about a third of the workforce home early because there's not enough for them to do!

Managers last less than six to twelve months (these folks typically leave Amazon because you can't transfer internally before 12 months are over). If you are an SDE, forget about stability and continuity.- As AWS becomes successful, the platform teams are getting political at the manager/sr. manager levels. The organization runs on fear. You don't know when you'll get thrown under the bus. It's less of an issue at the SDE level.- Expect to beg for productivity software and decent quality laptops/computer peripherals (or buy your own). This applies across Amazon.",

I worked in Retail Systems, and they are mostly bogged down in trouble tickets and constant feature requests from the business side, leaving little time to actually develop software. Furthermore, the paranoia about losing money leads to aversion toward software change, which means the code-base is\u2026\u00a0 a monstrous pile of incremental changes accumulated over the years. Almost no documentation, and I frequently would hear sentiments that documentation or comments would be a hindrance-- since that would mean having to maintain the documentation or comments in parallel with the code (this might have just been a cultural aspect of my team). There seems to be a revolving door for young developers, as well as people jumping around from team to team, so teams' know-how deteriorates to the point where there are large portions of code that no one is familiar with. And yet, you have to support that code when you are on-call. If you aren't familiar with on-call, it means getting paged at any time of day when there are problems with the software. You might be thrown into a scenario where you are responsible for Amazon ordering being down, and the problem lies in your team's software, but you aren't familiar with that part of the code. You will probably just have to relay this to your team members-- which is fine-- but needless to say it is stressful.I was promised to eventually get the chance to do some real software development, but perhaps not for a year or more. If you are in it for the long haul, maybe it could be okay.
