Contractor hiring at Facebook is typically used as a way to get around headcount limits, not as a thoughtful or strategic approach to staffing, and you will probably feel that. There are limited opportunities for conversion (though it's still a great way to get your foot in the technology door).-Poor investment in and accountability for managers. Many managers at Facebook were thrust into a management role because they were of an appropriate level - not because they are good managers. There is very little accountability for bad managers, and good management skills are rarely counted as notable. Early on, the company set a culture around managers not being different than anyone else - they just happened to manage.

You get to meet a lot of really gre\u2026\u00a0at people and see the world a bit this way.-Strong professional network. Facebook still attracts many of the best and brightest, and it's a privilege to get to work with them.-Engaging and interesting work. I can't think of a single boring job at Facebook. The company is still tackling some of the most interesting and challenging problems in technology today.-Great internal communication. Not many people talk about this, but Facebook runs almost entirely on Facebook groups, which is surprisingly efficient.

Couple that with the general immaturity of the company and you'll see some very poor judgement and \"Game of Thrones\" style politics in a few departments.Average tenure of a staff engineer is about 4 years - mostly because after the initial stock grants vest there is near zero incentive for anyone under a Director level to stay any \u2026\u00a0longer.Culture creates and fosters entitled whiners - so much so that it is a running joke inside the company, with groups such as \"Patently Absurd Requests for Facebook Offices\" making fun of it all. But then again, this company is largely made up of the \"participation trophy\" generation, who have been told they were super-special since they were born. Being hired by Facebook amplifies that self-esteem level well beyond eleven.It is never spoken about, but staff turnover is huge. The washout rate of n00bs is likely around 40%.
