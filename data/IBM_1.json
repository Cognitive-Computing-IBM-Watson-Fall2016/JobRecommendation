I did time with IBM as a contractor - the kind of employee they hire through another agency so they don't have to give them perks like decent pay, benefits, raises, vacation/personal/sick time, job security, or respect. Maybe if I worked harder on my golf swing I could've had a shot. The contractors were treated like dirt, and I think that's the whole reason we were h\u2026\u00a0ired like that - cheap labor to be abused like slaves. We worked just as hard, dare I say much harder than our supposed full fledged IBM employee coworkers but for much less money and no way to move up in the world! But shouldn't we be making so much money, you know, doing overtime? NO - overtime was frowned upon. Our time wasn't valuable enough to justify paying us more for. They could just hire another schlub at some low rate to take over for us when we were done. Sure they might be a complete idiot who might cause irreparable harm to client relations but they're cheap! As for raises, instead of raises we got annual pay CUTS - cuts that we were made to feel guilty about - our letters said we should be grateful that we got to keep our jobs, and that everyone had to sacrifice. Everyone meaning the contractors. Full employees were comfy and cozy with their nice checks and health insurance. Our schedules would change at a moment's notice. Can you work this weekend? Ok, well great, and by the way, because you said yes you're working every weekend from now on. Graveyard shift? Same deal. When IBM lost clients as they have a talent for, the contractors were cut loose without notice or severance. Some time before the Melville office closed a local newspaper ran an article about the fact that the offices were closing. IBM was quick to react, assuming doing absolutely nothing could be considered a reaction. Eventually a statement was issued that there were no plans to close the offices, and a meeting was held to that effect as well. Several days later a formal announcement was made that the offices were closing. And that was that.",

Of course\u2026\u00a0 I expected morefrom my manager, but I noticed that him and other first line managers at IBM were so muchinvolved with just managing their direct reports and waiting for a directive from above on whatto do, so they rarely if ever took initiative to propose any anticipatory changes or tuning.In March 2002 Sam Palmisano became the CEO of the company. He joined IBM in 1973 as asalesman in Baltimore and later moved up the ranks as senior managing director of operationsfor IBM Japan, senior vice president for the personal systems group, the enterprise systemsgroup and IBM global services, and president and chief operating officer. Shortly thereafter,when IBM Microelectronics announced its financial results for the first quarter of 2002, multi-million losses were revealed. Unfortunately, the senior management didn\u2019t or couldn\u2019t do muchto anticipate this, so now everyone was waiting what the new CEO would do in this difficultbusiness situation. At that point of time only reactive changes could be made. Instead ofadaptation, which in my opinion required a lot more skills from Palmisano, he chose re-creation.What was his solution? Massive job cuts. In June of 2002 approximately 1,500 out of 7,000employees were laid off in Burlington and I was one of them. Workers piled their belongings incardboard boxes and left the office for good, collecting pay for the next 60 days. Among 1,500employees who were laid off there was a substantial number of new hires who joined thecompany just a little bit more than a year ago.

Steve Appleton, theCEO of Micron, the Bo\u2026\u00a0ise, ID semiconductor company did just that under similar circumstances.In 2001 Micron was hit hard by a downturn in the microelectronics business and similar to IBMMicroelectronics needed to make layoffs. Appleton announced that his annual salary of $800,000would be dropping to zero!

If you want to keep your job, you need to be better then they are in the eyes of your manager. Being talented and hard working is not enough. You need to sell your ideas to managers. Most managers were talented engineers at one point, but manage\u2026\u00a0rs are shuffled often, so most manage groups whose work they have a limited understanding of. If you can't explain to your non-technical relative why you are valuable to IBM, you will struggle to keep your job, no matter how valuable you really are.There is a constant flow of people who join IBM right out of college and are gone within four years. About half find better jobs because they have IBM on their resume. The other half change fields entirely, or go back to school.A manager being laid off is unheard of. Non-managers generally distrust what managers say about layoffs, because managers are invulnerable and so have no empathy. The managers I had took every opportunity to say that yearly ratings were based on your performance and not compared to your pears. In other words, everyone under a manager could get a high rating. This was to fight a persistent rumor that managers can not give high rating to everyone. I believe the rumors are mostly true: A manager could give everyone a great rating, but other managers would question that manager's judgment, so in practice no manager does it.One trap to watch out for is moving to a town like Poughkeepsie NY, where IBM is a large chunk of the local economy, when IBM is at a hiring peak. The housing market moves with IBM's hiring or layoffs. If you buy a house when IBM is hiring, and are forced to sell it a few years later when IBM fires many people, the loss you will take on the house could easily be greater then a year's salary. Ouch.IBM tends to use technologies that are internal or not the industry standard. Often the IBM way was invented before the industry standard way, and often the IBM way is (or was) better by a small margin. Keep in mind that IBM may not be the last place you work before you retire, and make sure that you learn some skills that will allow you to get a job elsewhere. If you spend ten years at IBM and become an expert in the IBM method of making chips, you may find that you can not pass an interview to get a job making chips somewhere else.",

        "cons": "The current IBM US culture is a culture of open competition beneath a veneer of civility. The 'nice guys' get laid off, leaving the schemers and back-stabbers and team leaders who understand that whomever reports the status of a project controls who stays and who goes. Lies are commonplace as no one ever tells bad news. Low level management is swamped, impotent, and powerless. Yearly appraisals are a farce - the ten \u2026\u00a0percent 'fast-trackers' are openly praised and rewarded and everyone else is left alone or fired. There is no 'meritocracy' at IBM. A true meritocracy would know that it is possible for everyone to be meritorious, especially if you have hired the best people there are.At IBM the appraisal system is more of a lottery where one out of ten is treated as a champion and everyone else, the other 90 percent, are considered not good enough. The 90 percent, the serfs, are expected to fight amongst themselves and compete for the prized top spots. Since the contest for top dog is rigged and secret with no clear metrics, the serfs pretty much ignore the ratings and do what they can. Why work hard when you aren't rewarded? Why work hard when It is easier to play games and surf the web and grab open source stuff and pass problems around. If your job is a game of musical chairs for a year and a mad scramble at the end to pick the loser then why bust your butt? If the stock slumps no matter what you do then why bust your butt? If the company doesn't care about you then why care about the company?Layoffs are kept as secret as possible and happen quarterly. Actually the IBM management style is mostly secretive. Metrics change. What was good last year is bad this year. You never know where you stand. You may get a bonus 'variable pay' or get laid off. Management, even first line managers, are always 'somewhere else' talking about 'something else' and are hidden as much as possible. As a result fear is commonplace. It is every man for himself and nobody really knows what 'doing a good job' means anymore. Some of the best and brightest are layed off so what exactly does 'doing a great job' mean?",

You have lost touch with your humanity and \u2026\u00a0you are cowardly hiding behind your layers of PR and huge layers of bureaucracy.During the Great Depression TJ chose to have himself and IBM be a leader. Now, at a time of similar need, you are showing your true nature and vision and it is sadly, sadly lacking. You think Africa is the growth market for IBM? You ignore the big, big changes that are already starting regarding the end of cheap energy and the need for carbon caps and smart grids?!IBM is getting none of the recent stimulus money from the US government?!Sadly, the answer is that IBM is nothing anymore, IBM is just another poorly run company with no vision and no leader trying to optimize an outdated and failed business model. It is like IBM is being run by Republicans who think the answers to the future lie in the past, and that is very sad. It is very sad to see such a great company fall so very far.",

It is fair to say that you spend about 50% of your time co\u2026\u00a0llecting the data for and providing it to these systems. Thus, it is not possible to achieve the goals because you are spending most of your time measuring, but not making, progress.What matters most is to appear to make progress and appear to take responsibility. Over time, your colleagues become disembodied voices in faraway lands, and you spend a great deal of time in conference calls with them. What you quickly learn is that you can declare progress has been made, and no one is likely to know or care whether it was. I inherited, from IBMers who understood how the game is played, projects that recent college graduates would have done a better job of. I was appalled by the \"work\" of senior people. Thus, IBM is not a place to learn any skill other than that of self promotion.The cumulative impact is devastating. You don't see as much of the colleagues who are still around because you are always on the phone or trying (in vain) to get something done. The isolation gets to you. You become surprised that someone you worked with for years has a) left without saying anything or b) is still around because you haven't seen them in months. Most people work at home as much as possible.Before IBM came into your life, you knew what a good job was and you knew how to do it. If you stay too long, you begin to doubt that you know anything and are worth anything to another company and even to yourself. Toward the end of my tenure, more than one person expressed thoughts of suicide. The only folks who seemed to understand the true nature of what was happening were raised in eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.I left IBM. I was not laid off. I did not have another job lined up.
