These new acquisitions are put under the control of the Emerging Products Division and a VMware Business Unit Manager is assigned to each company. Over the next year to 18 months, your company\u2019s solutions are prepared for full integration (incubation as it\u2019s called internally) into the total overall solu\u2026\u00a0tions that the Core VMware Sales Team can offer their clients. VMware believes they have a toe hold in 85% of the entities out there and your company\u2019s solution is just another way to expand that foot print down the road. Once your solution is fully integrated into the Core, you\u2019re career at VMware will come to an end. You will find that many of the superstars at your company will have already left by then because they saw the writing on the wall from the beginning. Their work will have been tossed onto your plate with every departure. So, by the time your job comes to an end it might be a relief because you'll be burned out anyway. Sadly, today's VMware is a labor camp - policy and procedure has replaced creativity and innovation.If your company is acquired by VMware, enjoy the moment. Put it boldly on your resume and use that brand name to start opening doors at potential employers elsewhere. Most employers outside of VMware can\u2019t distinguish between the Core and Emerging Products Division and only care about you having big name experience.Advice to Management: Your tactics of \u201cmanaging by fear\u201d will come to haunt you later on. If you search the social sites, VMware\u2019s reputation has already been harmed by the thousands of ex-employees you\u2019ve alienated and lost through your acquisition policy.

In summary, the leadership of the vCloud Air team specifically has somehow become convinced that they actually know what they are doing. No longer is there a sense of experimentation and risk taking, which attracted some of the brightest minds from across the company and the industry to sign up for the journey, but instead in their place are arrogance, igno\u2026\u00a0rance, and politics. Arrogance is bread from the top down, with the \"leaders\" making arbitrary and damaging decisions while ignoring the informed counsel of the people WHO ACTUALLY DO THE JOB EVERYDAY. This leads to embarrassing displays of ignorance by the \"leaders\" in all hands presentations and customer meetings when false and/or falsified information is shared as the truth. And the politics of the place make it impossible for any of the smart folks who clearly know the information is untrue to call it out with their \"leaders\" for fear of retaliation in the form of public humiliation or firing.

And that truth is you \u2026\u00a0have lost your way VMware, and it begins from the top down. Your people are miserable, scared, tired of being lied to, and feeling powerless to do anything about it.

Management is entirely, 100% focused on revenue and becomin\u2026\u00a0g a $4B company - and the cuts show. Raises are next to nonexistent (even for internal promotions, which are rare.) Employees who used to have their cell phones taken care of by the company now have to \"Bring Your Own Mobile\" (this was billed as a great benefit to employees, but in reality we now have to purchase our own phones and pay for our own plans, with an entirely-to-small cap on what we can expense for monthly costs.) Rumor is they will be doing the same with laptops in the future, without giving employees any money towards purchasing their own computer. Within the next year, they play to eliminate vacation and sick leave (rather than earning leave, you will just \"work it out with your manager\" - I can only imagine this will cut back on the amount of vacation you can take.)Upper management has a decent vision but it is crippled by the all-encompassing focus on revenue. The company has a whole slew of useless VPs (many brought in and given lofty titles due to acquisitions.)
