As management has changed to Pat Gelsinger's team, the company has come to resemble EMC even more and is more execution driven than vision driven. Because we are typecast as \"just\" a hypervisor company, it is very difficult to sell what VMware now does to customers who are less than progressively minded from an IT perspectiv\u2026\u00a0e. When people think, \"Oh, VMware must be easy to sell\" they do not realize that the hypervisor and core platform is commoditized and the only way to make any significant sales is to have a customer that understands the cloud computing journey VMware is evangelizing and buys the adjacent products, etc.-Quotas are completely out of control. The norm the entire time I have been there is missing your quota. As long as you are clearly doing your job, etc, this doesn't seem to result in imminent firing your life as a sales rep will always be behind the 8 ball or subject to the 6 month quota cycle.-VMware has been in an \"awkward adolescence\" period for as long as I can remember. Systems, procedures, etc don't always make sense, and the certain key processes that matter to customers are completely broken. These will hurt your sales efforts.This last piece is not necessarily a con, but many of the experienced team members are moving out of individual contributor roles to management or more interesting roles or leaving. This is more a sign that the company is in a state of transition and existing players are moving up or moving out.
