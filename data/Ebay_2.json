Overall, solid planning and communication are sorely lacking at eBay. This \u2026\u00a0can be seen in John Donahoe's strategies that are aspirational in nature rather than actionable.

Not uncommon in companies of its size ob\u2026\u00a0viously. Cash comp is on the low side in my estimation, at least when I was there, and stock has gone nowhere but down or sideways taking away much of the motivation that was inherent in that part of the comp package earlier in the company's lifecycle. Skype and other management decisions seemed to decrease confidence in senior management's vision and skillset though there are many new faces now.

        "cons": "If you are at a senior level, you will not find much to learn here. The opportunities to have design discussions and do work with other designers in your field are very limited. This also means you have almost no chance to mentor a younger designer either. Projects are routinely scheduled to be much too short or way too long. Scoping of a project has not quite been figured out. There will be many things at eBay like \u2026\u00a0that. You will not be able to understand why so many small companies have figured out various communications and project planning and eBay is still trying to get it right. The atmosphere is extremely meeting heavy. Reviews for projects are routinely sent to entire distribution lists making it hard to find out which ones you might actually need to be in. Products are not owned by one designer and the excessive use of external contractors means the section of the site you are working on could have other projects you would not see going on at the same time. Engineering will often find it difficult to make projects as you design them since eBay tries to keep back end developers and cares little about GUI programming. Although testing by researchers is available for some projects, there is no easy to use central repository to help you when the project does not have a long time line, so it is hard to learn from others' work. One of the most frustrating things is the review process, which is both very, very long and completely useless. Peer reviews take forever to write since you have to convert all text to 'business, values' speak. The majority of people will come out as 'average' and when someone does over perform, they often do not deserve it and seem to get the promotion not for actual innovative work, but for making up some 'new' way to design, or some other 'outside your usual job' type of project. This means the designers hoping for promotion will 'phone in' their projects and reserve their energy for these extra projects that don't translate to a better UI on the site. If your goal is to make the site easier to use for the actual users, you will be disappointed at your inability to get your designs through the review process. Which is extensive. Further they have jumped on the patterns bandwagon a little too hard. If you have a design out of the pattern, extensive justification is required. Although you might think this makes the site more consistent, it doesn't. And it makes you avoid innovation.",

Stop trying to come up with a grand scheme and develop an easy to use, internal communication system that would allow us to search previous work and documentation.

People who work here (at least in UED) already focus on the customer, you are just catching up. If you want to have the corporate 'values' worn on each badge, read them and follow them.

Fun events are a regular happening, sometimes once a week. If you have the right Manager \u2026\u00a0- I do - many of the difficulties will seem less difficult. As far as I can tell, there is only the one so be careful which group you choose. The campus has on site parking (get here early) and nice size cubicles.

It's very much a culture of not rocking the boat.They are about 4 years behind in terms of design and technology. The development process is so fat and lumbering that it's going to be nearly impossible to catch up. I believe that they want to innovate and move faster, but the current system actually makes that extremely difficult and expensive.There's a lot of people with good ideas but they are buried under layers of management and \"stakeholders\" that often water ideas down until they are shadows of what they were supposed to be. The design review process is quite thick and in my opinion counter-intuitive to getting anything innovative or even evolutionary out there.

        "cons": "Upper management is inept and tends to \"swoop\" in and make arbitrary changes to projects without supporting data. Politics is nasty, especially on the business side of things. There is significant favoritism given towards skinny blonde chicks by some senior managers. It takes a lot of work to get products out. John Donahoe is, I expect, going to run the company into the ground; he doesn't understand the eBay ecosyste\u2026\u00a0m, and driving Rajiv Dutta out of the company was a truly crazy thing for him to do.",

        "advice": "Articulate a vision and get people invested in it. Right now, people are operating in crisis mode, but there isn't a lot of compelling reasons to stay. As the good folks hit the road with more and more frequency, \"put your head down and get your work done\" is less a rallying cry and more a threat.
