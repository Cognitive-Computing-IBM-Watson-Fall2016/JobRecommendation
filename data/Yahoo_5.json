It's a bit intimidating at first the level of responsibility you're given, but it's awesome. I meet with my manager regularly, have a few mentors who have helped provide additional perspective, and an executive coach who works with me on \u2026\u00a0developing my leadership style, communication skills, and anything else I need help with.Throughout the year, we have chats with SVPs, Design directors, Architects, and other teams such as the Accessibility Labs and User Research groups, to learn more about what they consider / how they approach product. We have outings and fun events with our class and other APMs. We also went on a 2wk international trip to study tech markets in Israel and Asia, specifically focusing on how tech is created & consumed in those regions by speaking with venture firms, startups, tech policy makers, and university research labs.There is a lot of change, and keeping up with it can sometimes be challenging. However, I've found that this has helped me work more flexibly, so I'd consider it both a pro and a con. Yahoo can only grow as quickly as it has if there is constant transformation, which requires change as the company evolves. It's a special time in the company's history to be here, and it's cool that my work has such a large impact!If you want to be challenged to do great things with the support system of champions, the Yahoo APM Program is the place to be.",

For example, at Yahoo they used to not only have a company shuttle for commuting but also they paid for my VTA via a Clipper. Google does not provide for VTA. Yahoo gave me a free\u2026\u00a0 Mi-fi device which was super cool. They also gave me a phone and paid for the entire unlimited data plan. The food at Yahoo is amazing and for me in particular they had a juice bar that I miss very much. You can basically tell them to put together any combination of fruits and vegetables to make any smoothie or juice you want. Google does not have that so I miss it for sure. The office spaces at Yahoo are really aesthetically pleasing and very well-lit. At Google my current office has almost no light. The culture at Yahoo is amazing with regular company-wide events where celebrities like Jennifer Lawrence or the Guardians of the Galaxy or sports stars come over etc.. Lots of awesome parties. They have a weekly sitdown between the entire company and the CEO along with all her execs where we could ask them any questions we want. The company has a lot of successes that gets hidden by the decline of Yahoo's old businesses, but if you are are employee in one of the focus areas of Merissa Meyers then its a really awesome place to be.",
