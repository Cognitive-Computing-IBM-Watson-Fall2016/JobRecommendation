Many employees tend to have a false sense of confidence about their smarts and knowledge base, as evidenced by the smug and arrogant attitudes they seem to have about matters even outside of their fields of expertise. Most employees know only their limited field and role, and do not stop to consider the extent to which life exists outside of their tiny contribution, and Google itself. An extreme emphasis is placed on wealth and material possessions, such that the company culture feels empty, sterile, and mindlessly capitalistic.

It attracts so many talent people to work for this company, but in fact, the only give software engineers the special treatment. I've seen so many great engineers in operation team were treated like nothing.1. management sucksMy manager is the root cause that every engineer suffers. He is the best politician I have ever seen in my life. Eve\u2026\u00a0r since he promoted to be a manager, he started to play all the dirty games among us.He spent $20 mil per year on some equipments which melt down network connectivity so many times every month. He claimed that the equipments would save Google for 10 millions per year, but in fact, we spent a lot more work hours on trying to solve the problems these junks caused. The main problem is, there is no test base for these junks. Aren't we supposed to test all the equipment before we implement or even purchase them? Not these junks... how does it happen? pick ur guess!How about we go the manger above him. Too bad.. the upper manager is his buddy. There is no complain or any bad thing would ever leak out through these 2 layers of managers. They cover everything up very well. In fact, one of the manager's jobs should ensure the fairness. Well... \"fairness\" is NEVER been seen at this team.2. politics tricksMy manager has this policy: all the engineers under level III can not talk to the engineers above level IV. Well.... before I join google, I thought anyone could talk directly to anyone, even to CEO. But my manager fired a person who asked questions to a level IV.His recently move was - promoted two of his favorites to be managers and directly reported to him. You know what it means? He just promoted himself since there are two managers reporting to him now. That was the exact trick his upper manager did a couple years ago. Now... there are 3 levels of management under one director. How does this director allow this happen?? well.. that's the politics. So, when the new engineer join the team, how many levels above him?? It's IMPOSSIBLE that you get promoted if there is one new layer added. Most likely, you got downgraded every year!!3. STEALING/CHEATINGI've never seen so many cheating cases ever since I graduated from college, but here, at Google. We have two level IV engineers responsible for designing networks with one stealing ideas/credits from the other one's work!! And this cheating is permitted by the upper manager!! How did it happen? well... the managers playing the games. The two (now three) levels managers ensures that none of outside team could work with the talent engineer alone. When they steals, those seniors all lined up and the upper manager would give pressure down to turn in the design and the credits. Whoever on the same side of this level IV engineer would suffer a hard time and have bad reviews from those managers. So, we watched the stealing and cheating happening every day but no one dare to say anything.<to be continued>",

You aren't allowed to rate your experience working with a person. You're supposed to somehow rate their entire accomplishment including stuff that you had nothing to do with. And if your stack ranks differ greatly from your manager's opinion of the latter they will passive aggressively hint that it will be a reason for firing you.Valve has a much better stack ranking system where people just rate their own experience working with a person and all feedback is anonymous. Also unlike Valve, Google has no freedom of association with whatever projects you want to do. It's all top-down mandates and selfish horse-trading by psychopathic middle managers.I've read about the toxic culture that killed Microsoft and it sounds very similar to Google in my experience.

It doesn't matter if you have 10 years of experience in that language. It doesn't matter if yo\u2026\u00a0u have certificate from the company that developed this language. And in order to get readability you would need to write a lot of code in that language. Catch-22. Also, you would have to wait for a pretty long time in the readability queue in order to just start with process. You fill like you lost all the experience you had before with this language. Somebody who has readability and has less experience in this language than you will have power over you. You would have to persuade this other person that your code is OK.Hypocrisy. They still have courses at Google where they teach you that it is important to have a rest, it is important to manage your energy, it is important to work when you are excited and energized and not work when you're not. This is why they have all those massage chairs. It used to be the company that valued all this. It all changed. I saw my manager writing in 2am and then writing in 6am again. Manager sets an example for it's subordinates and this example is terrible. I also remember my manager writing email about his current state that he is sick. At the same email he tells that \"he will do his best to do some work\". At the same time this same manager tells everybody else that \"if you're sick - go home and take a rest and don't work\". I lost respect for my manager long time ago.They want you to deliver results as soon as possible and yet they don't give you the ability to do it. Instead of JUST DOING IT you would have to write design docs with the future possible architecture (which will always be different because we can't predict software development) and persuade people who have more power than you. Those people will do their best to make sure you don't just start working on your code. You would have to pass several rounds of this absurd.They told me it is very important to predict how much time it would take to finish the project. I asked them what is the technique to predict unpredictable and got no answer in return. They told me it is very important to make sure you did your project as close to your predictions as possible. I asked them what stops people from deliberately giving very large estimates, completing a project sooner and just do nothing for the rest of the time. I got no answer in return.

Google pushes a highly \"googley\" atmosphere, which is something akin to what the Brady Bunch would be like if they lived in communist Russia. Everything from the carpet to the bathroom tiles incorporate the Google colors into its design. People are encouraged to have googley attitudes, wear plastic smil\u2026\u00a0es, and not to question the infallible nature of the executive management group. Marathon hours are the standard because, after all, employees are practically encouraged to bring a cot and sleep there\u2026barracks coming soon (really?! no, not really). If you like feeling awkward during forced group activity, Google is your haven. It isn't exactly \"forced\" (no guns), but if you don't participate you become labeled as \"ungoogley.\" Once deemed \u201cungoogley\u201d, you're practically viewed as a rotten apple that threatens to spoil the bunch. If you can endure and appreciate the googley atmosphere, you might also enjoy Google's uncanny ability to clot information within the hierarchy. Very little is shared throughout the company because from the moment you're hired, secrecy is revered. But to be honest, most of those who read this review won't even be able to get a job there. Whether you're right out of college or are putting your kids through college, your academic standing will be asked about, your transcripts required. If you went to Podunk U, your chances are worse than the rumored 1% of applicants. I'm not saying that high standards aren't important, but Google discriminates against creative and diverse applicants by employing such arbitrary standards.

You aren't above traditional marketing, and when the AdWords profits stagnate, you'll change your tune. Google has only touched the tip of the iceberg in terms of users, but seems to focus on a very small niche of the internet market (we're not all open-source users and tech-geeks [don't get me wrong, I love a good tech geek]); it's in the company's best interest to drop the elitist niche/attitude and truly become the people's company.",

Breakfast, lunch and dinner are offered Monday through Friday, and the food is pretty good (keep in mind I'm comparing it to other free food\u2026\u2026\u00a0so how can you really complain?). Google-colored Swiss balls (those bouncy orbs you see freakishly fit people doing sit-ups on in infomercials) invade the office cubicles and give the workspace a much more play-pen sort of feel. To bolster the dorm room ambiance, Google also supplies pinball machines; foosball, ping pong & pool tables; and assorted video games. Foam darts are passed out for 'dart wars' during especially hectic times, and silently encourage the employees to roll away from their ergonomically arranged desks to fling projectiles at unsuspecting coworkers. After a grueling week of work, an employee can look forward to a company-funded bender in the form of microbrew beer (both on tap and in bottles!), wine, and the occasional Jell-O shot. If the alcohol upsets your stomach and a retreat to a bathroom is what you crave, fear not! In addition to having showers in almost every building, Google boasts toilets with heated seats, built-in bidets, and dryers for those who prefer to relieve themselves in a more \"green\" fashion.",

It's not uncommon for entire teams to be uprooted or replaced in one fell swoop.

In effect, you are getting \u2026\u00a0paid to learn new skills, and due to the \"act now, think later\" Google mindset, it's generally okay to make mistakes as you learn. World-renowned industry experts regularly lecture at Google, giving the campus an even stronger college-like feel.

Many managers at Google got their jobs just by having low employee numbers and are otherwise unqualified.

Google is supposed to have a project matrix where tech leads are peers,\u2026\u00a0 not managers, but managers commonly flout this and micromanaging is endemic. Moving between projects is limited by complex procedures and is rarely attempted. In satellite offices the selection of projects to work on is limited and to make matters worse it is discouraged for engineers to work on projects not centered in their own offices. Being friends with your manager is a more effective way to get promoted than showing competence. In fact, showing too much competence or initiative is a good way to earn the ire of your manager. Performance evaluation is supposed to be by peer review but in reality, feedback from peers is ignored and only the manager's rating is taken seriously. Political infighting and character assassination are increasingly the norm at Google. Managers turn a blind eye to it, perhaps because they have found such techniques useful in developing their own careers. Google base compensation is on the low side, and is supposed to be more than made up for by incentive bonuses, but these are largely illusionary because few employees receive the necessary \"exceeds expectations\" performance evaluation. Managers at Google tend to consider themselves special people, better than engineers. Few will bother to greet or otherwise acknowledge the existence of anybody other than another manager if they pass them in the hall. Except for the weekly TGIF cross-company sessions where the founders candidly answer questions from all employees, management at Google is increasingly secretive about procedures and plans.",

Stop listening to the voices of managers telling you what a great job they are doing, because their main skill is self promoti\u2026\u00a0on. They don't care about the welfare of the company or their reports, only about themselves. From their point of view the system is working well because they are free to do as they please.
