I was unfortunately in the consulting group to face the customers with the HRMS suite of products. And honestly there are no good products in Oracle Ebusiness Suite with the exception of financials. Being lowest in the hierarchy makes you take lot o\u2026\u00a0f heat. Consulting is the worst performing division of Oracle apparently. The field consultants are the ones who feel the heat of the bad products.The only part of consulting that makes money is the consulting sales people. They get commissions based on the engagements with various projects. They are no better than used-car sales people - and can go to any extent to play with consultants. They place one consultant against the other with the customers, and humiliate the consultants. Their only motto is to make the commission on the engagements. This can be noticeably seen with sales people helping small and medium businesses. The large customers usually are referred to the partners or independent contractors. The project managers mint money on these large scale projects.On the whole, the consultants suffer with enormous travel, bad working conditions at the customer locations, and hence most of the good consultants leave after spending a few years. Those who cannot risk to venture out stay back. On the whole the Oracle consulting's success rate on the projects is even less than 50%.There is no job security in consulting, no career advancement opportunities as the cost center managers do not encourage in-class trainings owing to save money.

It really is a gamble each and every month you're there and just because you've had a good year this year, you can easily be on the chopping block for termination 3 months down the road. If you are lucky to have a good territory, then the way to make your money is to audit each and every customer for using Oracle's IP out of compliance.. That's right, you're a glorified auditor, not a professional sales person because everything is tied up in Oracle's clever T's and C's. Hence, most of Oracle's customers hate Oracle.

There is an HR policy that only permits Lateral or Lower grade-level transfers for employees moving to an internally posted job -- even for promotions.

Any grade-level changes can only be considered at the beginning of the following fiscal year, at which time, many other variables come into play: Your manager must then provide a stellar review, submit a business case for a promotion, jump through hoops, get approvals, etc.Also, when applying to an internally posted job, you must inform your current manager, before you receive a formal offer from HR. Yes, before. So essentially, if the offer is not what you expect, you are more than likely in an extremely precarious position with your current manager/organization and must seek alternative employment outside of the company, immediately thereafter.Sales Compensation Plans are inconsistent and do not accurately reward talent or results. Some Sales employees in a given year do extremely well, while other solid performers are forced to survive on their base salary. Also, little to no stock option awards are distributed to the mainstream workforce.",

Worst of all, most sales staff are paid way below the industry standard, and accounting frequently with-hold commission payments as a tactic to push people out.
