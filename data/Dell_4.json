This could be because the older individuals are paid more. After nearly eight years, and two promotions I was laid-off. I was told my position was bein\u2026\u00a0g terminated, and I was given two weeks to find another position within Dell. Strangely, the other manager that took over my team was male and 20 years younger. Additionally, this manager only had six months management experience compared to my 20 years experience.

This would actually result in even greater savings for Dell; since, there would be very little need for termination packages.I know when I was laid-off, there were many positions that fit my background, but getting an opportunity for an interview was nearly impossible within 15 days.Bottom-line, should there be a performance issue, Dell does need to terminate employment. However, when there is not a performance issue, doesn\u2019t it make sense to simply move your resources from one group to another groups to fill open positions?
