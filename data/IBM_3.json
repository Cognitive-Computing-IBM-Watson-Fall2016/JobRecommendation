        "cons": "IBM STG seems to be the \"black sheep\" of the various IBM divisions. The success of several other IBM service divisions is very linked to the the STG hardware and technology, and IBM's model of providing overall solutions. Unfortunately, this model would work well if all the business units were treated as one. Since this is not the case, and the corporate mandate is for STG to provide technology first and foremost to \u2026\u00a0IBM, that business unit is always getting the short end of the stick when the quarterly numbers are reported. This translates into vastly lower bonuses and profit sharing due to the lower performance numbers. If that unit treated the rest of IBM as it does the rest of its customers and charged accordingly for their services the numbers would look much better. Morale is low in the STG division due to this and the fact that when lay-offs roll around, that is the first place that gets hit. Another problem within IBM is that it still carries with it a great deal of history of how things were and get done. This creates a LOT of inertia to overcome in order to drive changes or improvement. Not that it is impossible (I speak from experience) but it does require a greater commitment of time and energy. Time tends to be a very limited resource due to the cutbacks in personal and the increase in workload. The other item that seems to really need work is the innovation reward system IBM has established. IBM rewards people for ideas and patents, but the system is set up so that it can be \"gamed\" by people who have been at it for a while. It doesn't really produce new innovations that could lead to new business opportunites as much as incremental improvements in current technologies or ideas that will reward the submitter but doesn't provide new ventures for IBM.",
        "advice": "Morale needs to change, people walk around with the fear of the next lay-off or the people that were lost and it impacts the ability to get things done. The patent process should be reviewed and modified to really drive towards ideas that will provide new revenue streams, or a process should be implemented that reviews ideas and their marketability in order to get them licensed. IBM needs to develop a method of bring\u2026\u00a0ing STG into the greater fold of IBM and treating them more equittably or spin them off and let them pursue their own business dealings. I would bet the IBM's appreciation of STG would increase dramatically if they had to deal with them as they do with Intel or others.

I worked with talented people who seemed happy to share their experiences with me, and to help me grow.

IBM is first and foremost a business. This may be a good company for an MBA, not necessarily for an engineer.Specifically as a staff software engineer, some of the downsides are long hours, little input to the decision making process and little consideration for work/life balance.

Another downside is the increased managing of earnings. Many sales people leave because of\u2026\u00a0 retroactive quota increases, the feeling that they cannot impact their quotas/ objectives and that there is no career path for sales. The account executives rule the roost and this is the epicenter of the good old boys territory.
