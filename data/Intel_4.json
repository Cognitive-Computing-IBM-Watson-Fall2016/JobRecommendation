This is the most frustrating factor at times and can be quite distracting. It always seems to take too much time to make decisions and I often feel we miss opportunity because senior management has a hard time making the hard choices.",
        "advice": "Start making the hard choices much quicker. Sticking with something that isn't working, which is obvious all the way down to the front line, is very frustrating and demotivating. Listen more to the people doing the work instead of thinking you know where we should go.",
        "pros": "Intel has a lot of different opportunities to try new things. You can move between hardware, software, firmware or any of the business management jobs quite easily. Not to mention working on cutting edge technology and a wealth of very talented and fun people to work and learn from. Intel is the most diverse company I have ever worked with, and this is one of the main factors I like about the company.",

In addition, performance isn't always directly rewarded during end of year reviews (you could have a really super couple of years and still not get adequate recognition).3. Pay isn't \u2026\u00a0competitive with software companies.4. Benefits -- no 401K matching for instance.",
