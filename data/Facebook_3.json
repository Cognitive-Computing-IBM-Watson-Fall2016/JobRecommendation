I started as an early career employee and one of the main reasons I left was because I felt like there was really little investment in my professional and personal growth. I found that Facebook really likes employees that will work hard and make them look good, but they don't care about helping \u2026\u00a0you move up to the next level. There was no clear progression. A part of this is the flat organizational structure, which appeals to some but not to all.- Very millennial feeling (I'm a millennial too) and can feel extremely unprofessional at times. No line between personal and professional relationships. Again, this is up to personal choice but it didn't feel great to me all the time.- Cult-like worship of upper management (Mark and Sheryl). They are awesome people to look up to but people are not critical enough of the company all the time. It felt like people were always blind-sided by the flashiness of M-team's messaging.- Facebook hires a lot of contractors to full-time positions (especially in Austin), which can feel irksome.- Since the company has grown so much, they need to stop acting like a startup.- It's easy to do work that isn't actually fulfilling but is necessary to run the company.- Loved the mission and messaging of the company but didn't feel like my work was impactful in any way, which was an unfortunate feeling.- Pay is not that good for entry level/early career business side roles. Engineers make a lot more, unsurprisingly.- This is an engineer-run company, after all. So if you are on the business side, expect to be heavily reliant on engineering resources, which can be extremely draining and frustrating.- Facebook says it's easy to transition between roles and teams but I found that to not be true. That's another reason why I left. It may be easier on the engineering side. Additionally, being a remote office truly limits your networking and career opportunities (even if they tell you otherwise).- I had more managers than I could count in one year. The turnover was way too high and I didn't feel like anyone was invested in me. I wasn't growing and as an early career professional, growth is my top priority.- Facebook is a global company and most of its users are outside of the US. However, the mindset is still extremely American and I frankly found the way in which people talked about users outside of the US to be downright offensive at times. There was no desire to get to deeply understand user behavior and market trends outside of the US. Given how the world economy is trending, Facebook will be in a bad position if employee mindsets don't change. There are companies all over the world (especially in Asia) that are taking over (and have already taken over) the spaces Facebook is trying to break into as of late.- A combination of unclear expectations and high manager turnover led to not-stellar performance reviews for me.- People always said I could work on what interested me and what I was good at but whenever I tried to do so, I was shut down.",

While there aren't any Office Space-style TPS reports to fill out and you don't have to bring in your own coffee and toilet paper, it is now just a big company job like any other. If you want something, whether it be a promotion or a good dessert from the cafeteria, you have to plan how to get it, execute on the plan, an\u2026\u00a0d then make sure everyone else knows what you did and how great it was. You also have to share just enough detail to be convincing but not so much that people can poke holes in your story or usurp your dessert acquisition techniques.The typical first level line manager at Facebook doesn't have prior management experience, only knows the Facebook way of doing things, and is overwhelmed with all the pressure being placed on them. It's a really hard job, too; your manager will be responsible both for setting the direction of your team and for making sure you and your colleagues grow at the company. Most people are not good at either of those things, let alone both. Be aware of what your manager is looking for and how to best communicate it.Everything FB does is subject to a lot of public scrutiny, and you will know how the sausage is made and see that the goals of the company aren't focused on invading privacy or global domination like everyone else thinks. It's hard to see this thing that takes up so much of your life lionized and loathed by the press and your friends.For engineers, a lot of the tools you will use day-to-day are incomplete, broken, poorly documented, and might not be supported anymore. You will get used to this. \"Move fast and break things\" is more complicated than it sounds, and that's really hard to adapt to when coming from a more traditional company.

Teach people how to be successful and reward individuals that focus on impact that makes everyone's w\u2026\u00a0ork easier and the product better, not on whatever new hotness made a contrived graph go in the right direction.

The benefits and conveniences offered are amazing.M\u2026\u00a0any decisions about the company and its goals are made fairly transparently and open discussion about most things is encouraged. This can get really annoying at times.Unlike most companies, Zuck is actually a pretty inspiring leader. He makes mistakes, but does learn from them. He has really lofty goals, though, and doing the right thing is highly subjective when trying to change the world.If you are politically savvy and willing to work hard and make sure others notice that hard work, you will go far.

You will likely take\u2026\u00a0 a pay cut coming to Facebook, and even with all the great benefits, you still need to pay a mortgage/rent, bills, and future savings. Similar to other organizations, there are two primary types of sellers (Account Managers & Account Executives) at Facebook these roles are basically the same with different titles and pay scales.*As a seller, you are not properly incentivized to go above & beyond what is expected of you, in many cases if you exceed you're goal it actually hurts your compensation for the future due to the disproportionate weight your achievement is given for the future. I don't know a soul at the company who doesn't live and breathe what we do (consider this a pro or a con) but every quarter we are expected to work exponentially harder to deliver exponentially greater results while getting paid the same (or less if you are unable to deliver to the goal that was set)*Management is unfortunately a disappointment - from the VP level down, the sales management team does not add much value. At the VP/Director level, a vast majority of people do not feel as though this person/people provide inspiration, guidance, or true leadership qualities. Through a recent reorganization, it seems lack of leadership and inspiration will only continue to be perpetuated. This is not meant to be a personal attack on any one specifically, but the irony of working at such a social and high profile company is that the Sales leadership are some of the most uninspiring and unimpressive individuals at the company.*It feels extremely political. We have a well documented belief in openness, and cutting through red tape to do whats best for the organization. At the end of the day, the sales organization does not feel like like it is held to the same standard. People feel like they have to walk on eggshells about what kind of feedback they provide to their managers or management in general, favoritism from mid level managers to the director level runs rampant - know how to play the game. Often times decisions feel like they have been made based on what is good for a particular individual (what will make them look good to their own manager) versus what is best for the company and from this view point it appears that it pays off for those people who think of themselves before the company.
