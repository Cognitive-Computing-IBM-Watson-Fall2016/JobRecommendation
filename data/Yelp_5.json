Until you find your groove, you'll definitely have to hustle.But management knows this and is there for you. Be sure to ask and lea\u2026\u00a0rn from them after training.- Even with commissions, bonuses, raises down the line, the 36k starting base salary is very low for the San Francisco Bay Area.- Lunch options are basically deli sandwiches (known as the \"Yelp-wich\"), microwaveable convenience foods, and snacks.

Dominated by millennials.Great people, social environment, theme days, off-sites with your team around the Bay, happy hours on the top floor after work on Fridays, people and culture make it worth it. Authenticity and being yourself is one of the company's biggest values.You start off with a two-month training with your class of new hires, where you're put in a team of fellow trainees and a training manager. You learn all about selling Yelp, and hit the phones on the second week. After the two months, your team either rolls out together with your manager, or you get put on an already existing team.From the beginning, management is very real with you - they acknowledge that \"the job can suck at first,\" and encourage you to look at it with some perspective. They're there for you when you're going through a slump, and really care about your development in the role. And communication is very direct and open, in line with the culture.There is little to no drama or unnecessary micromanaging, negativity, etc. Managers do vary and I may have gotten lucky since I was on a great team, but I didn't see too much deviation from this for the most part.Also, the company is pretty transparent with the C-suite - the VP of Sales comes down to the floor sometimes to see how everybody's doing, and there's a monthly round-up where he addresses the whole of SF Sales. Jeremy Stoppelman the CEO has addressed employees quite often.- 8-5 set work hours including 1-hour lunch - 40 hours per five-day work week.- General expectations of 65 calls a day and/or 2 hours of talk time.- Stocked kitchen for breakfast and lunch.- Get to work in downtown San Francisco - great location!
