However, we did recently release a cost per click ad program that is a huge stride forward, but still has some big flaws. You will get yelled at, and you will get hung up on.

If you're looking for a company that pays well as a base, don't expect Yelp to satisfy that hunger. Starting salary for all sales executives is 34K base, hardly enough to get by and definitely underpaid in the Bay Area as any other company starts you off at 50+ including commission.On that note, if you do well, \u2026\u00a0the commission structure is very decent. However, this probably only applies to the top 5% of the Yelp's top sales reps as the other 95% are generally average and don't make much after you consider living in such an expensive city and don't push yourself. They used to require employees to bring in double what they currently except before earning commission, but lowered it as their retention over the last 5 months hasn't been great - in fact, probably the worst in company history.They always tell you that it's not about territory, but it is. And they match the top sellers with top territories, Elites get first dibs, and if you don't do very well or if you're just average, you get average territories - which doesn't entirely make sense. They recently made a huge change and mixed up territories along with other changes. Needless to say, after failing 2-3 months, they changed it back because it wasn't well thought out and caused a lot of employees who have been there long term and short term to leave.New changes in 2015 has raised a lot of eyebrows. The compensation prior used to be more fair, as they counted your gross revenue rather than your net. You obviously have no control after you make the sale and how business owners manage their accounts, if they even do. And the Account Management teams are less than good. You'll have better luck managing your own accounts as each business gets a couple of AM's assigned to them during their advertising term because they keep leaving, with no word and your scared business clients just sit there, calling you ten times a week and flooding your emails because they have no idea what's going on.Retention is low. Given my time here, I would say Yelp retains about 20% of individuals after a year, maybe a little less. You have to consider the fact that the company is hiring 30-60 disposable individuals a month who are excited and drinking the coolaid, until they're not. At which point, the rookies have made more for the company than the company realistically pays you. If it's not you, it's another 60 new individuals every single month.Lastly, engineers are great - but your sales team makes the company money and sells products that engineers come up with. Don't just feed your engineers and have sales get scraps. Sales or anyone else in the organization (sales being biggest) get to eat AFTER engineers have their lunch - we get their leftovers.

At Yelp you are taught that spending thousands of dollars a month on advertising should be a drop in the bucket. After seeing the books for a small business, and paying things like office rent, payroll, insurances, supplies, and things like that I now see that spending or saving the money that Yelp Advertising costs would be a much smarter business move.

I've had problems sleeping at night selling the lowest level CPM but have to do it because the client won't do anything else. And then it doesn't work and they get mad. -.-There are also asinine comp battles you may have to fight due to an account deciding they want to sign up for \"self serve\" advertising after you send a contract for full service advertising, or when two people own different locations of the same account, or other really dumb things.

Don't let the toys fool you, no one ever has time to kick back and shoot hoops when you're expected to stay (quite literally) chained to your phone making more dials as the same loud pop playlist blares in the background of your calls. I often only see managers playing games, ironically.Last week our director tried to leverage the free food and coff\u2026\u00a0ee as to why our base salaries are so low. Have to say, that was pretty weak. Cheap lunch meat with 1,200 hands in it everyday and a barista station I personally never use are not good reasons to underpay employees. Fully paid benefits are nice (way to stay competitive with literally every other tech company), still no excuse for a 35K base when most people don't see commission for a year or more (if they don't quit sooner.) I took the job to get experience, but probably wouldn't have if they didn't overpromise on the commission front.Which brings me to yet another con: territories. Managers will find a way to make you pay for even bringing it up, by giving you a new (but worse) territory or just giving you the cold shoulder with your concerns, but whether or not you succeed here largely depends on where you call into. Makes sense. You will close way more calling into a metropolitan American city than you will Nowheresville, Canada. But they act like everyone is given equal opportunity. Even if one area has 5x the volume of sellable businesses, they act like it's entirely your problem if you're not reaching the same numbers in your \"non-Yelpy\" territory. What's worse is that you're stack ranked solely on revenue, so all contests, promotions, shout outs and accolades are awarded to high sellers, no matter the advantages they have in the territory system. Territories can be switched without notice org-wide, which happened recently, and you will lose all of your accounts unless you can close but 15 of them in 15 days. Lastly, like I said, everything is stack ranked per revenue, so your next territory is based on how well you do with the one before it. Do I need to explain further?Managers. Mostly 23-25 year olds with no previous experience and have only ever worked for Yelp. They will cheerlead you until the cows come home, but at the end of the day they're there to babysit your metrics and make sure you're putting out 80 dials and 2.5 hours of talk time daily. Other reps have had better luck, but no manager has ever been able to help me close a call. I have had 4 of them so far. Just goes to show you success at Yelp depends on the hand you're dealt up front in terms of territories and management.Meager time off. Meager sick leave. An overall very stressful job with little returns on your investment with Yelp. Now I know exactly what a boiler room is.",

Some of the training presentations are laughable, still referring to themselves as a \"startup\" despite being a massive publicly traded company. Statistics given as sales ammo to send to clients and in training are all conveniently tailored to hide the last couple years of downward trends. The advertising product can work for some, although most sales seem to be to owners who do not fully understand what they are buying. I did not feel good about many of my sales, feeling scummy for selling expensive packages to businesses who could not afford them nor fully understood how to use the site. My biggest problem with the job is not talking down furious owners who hate yelp with a passion, but the reality that every quality lead has been called 50-100 times in the last few years and they know the snake oil you are selling the second you tell them you are from Yelp.

I get that you need to hit numbers, but that shouldn't be at the cost of ruining relationships with small businesses, which just keeps happening more and more.Also pay people over time!!!

The ones making huge amounts of money have NYC, LA, Chicago etc. They make it seem like you too can make 10k commission checks.

        "cons": "While the list of pros is very enticing the benefits of working at Yelp, in my opinion, fail to outweigh the unfortunate reality of what the job is. Truthfully, management is as helpful as they can be from an instructional/leadership standpoint, but it is insurmountably difficult to make amends for the brutality of the position. You're given a territory of burned out, recently called/pitched accounts that have been c\u2026\u00a0alled on dozens of times per month prior to you picking up the phone. Most of the business owners you talk to express immediate frustration with you and disinterest in the product within seconds. Of course, this what inside sales is all about, and I don't fault Yelp for the job function itself. Moreover, your days have no variety- as you're expected to make over 80 dials, talk for over 2 hours on the phone, and hit a variety of other metrics, most of which are pretty much attainable. It's not a difficult job to be OK or passable at, but it's a difficult job to excel at. I left after two months and at that point nearly on third of my hiring class was gone. Within my first week of my new job, my office had received 3 resumes from AE's trying to flee the Yelp phone center. I don't blame them. So, reader, if you're a recent or soon to be recent college grad looking to get into sales, this job is definitely exciting at first, but unless you're a robot who is fine with making a career out of sitting at a computer talking to people who already hate you, this job is an average experience at best. Look for something else unless you're truly committed to the exrcutiating experience of inside sales.",
        "advice": "Offer more transparency during interviews about the expectations of the job. Raise the base pay about 5-10k, spend more time training and role playing prior to throwing kids on the phones, teach good pipeline management skills BEFORE AE's hop on the phone and wreck their pipelines, and somehow devise a system of more equitable account distribution.",

I owe Yelp's sales training program for helping me land a better sales position making almost double my first year out of school.On the contrary, don't kid yourself. This is a telemarketing position masked by a clever title, behind the facade of the \"hip\" tech company image that you can brag to friends \u2026\u00a0about. Be prepared for a high volume of calls and voicemails under strict micromanagement.I sold advertising part-time for 2 years during college, and Yelp is a very hard sell. They already have an extremely bad rep with business owners, and on top of that, the businesses have already been called by a rotation of rookie account executives, nonstop for years. Most calls end after you say you're from yelp.Some people love the culture there, and I did to an extent, but there are a lot of things wrong with it.Yelp has transitioned from tech start up to corporate sweatshop, and they try to preserve the image with free snacks, loud music, foosball, and obnoxious speeches from the directors. Once you're used to the amenities, monotony and regimented daily tasks will wear you down until you start sending out applications. It was a running joke amongst coworkers that it felt like we were still in high school with how each day was structured.Most of the people you become friends with will be gone by the 6 month mark, readily replaced by the massive amounts of new hires pumped on to the sales floor each month.The Yelp team is very cult like which some people enjoy, but I found it very distracting. You will not succeed at this position unless you \"drink the kool aid,\" regurgitate what your managers tell you to say, and let the company completely take over your persona.When it's all said and done, Yelp will give you great sales experience and help you get a better job, but this is not a career if that is what you're searching for.",
        "advice": "The managers are great, energetic, and very supportive. Some should focus less on metrics and more on revenue.

They do tell you what you are getting into and set the right expectations, but ultimately there is so much that is out of the control of you and for the most part management too.They preach fairness and that everyone is doing the same job, at the end of the day that is just not true... some people call into the middle of nowhere and some call into the Yelp-iest of areas, there is some luck. \u2026\u00a0Highly emotional sales role, not selling to people who make purchasing decisions with logic, rather with emotions. There were many times that the program failed the client and they come back to the sales rep who has no control over the success. I found it pretty hard to sell something that I ultimately did not believe in for every client, but the way the kool-aid drinking works, you have to sell to all of you assigned clients as if it will work for them too. I found this to be very disingenuous.Praise is definitely handed out for all kinds of small achievements, but they treat some like gods.This is where it honestly can get a little catty, there are hundreds of 23 year olds who are competitive by nature and very outgoing in general- thats why they got the sales roles- and the culture sometimes can flip on itself and wear you down. Its fun and young, but its also annoyingly young and dumb. With that, it was a good place to make new friends..On the young note, the management that I saw was often way too green and fresh to provide proper leadership. Some were immature, some too emotional, and others not masters of the job yet themselves. I think that this rose out of the desire to grow so quickly and expand (very revenue driven) that they were forced to promote people who were not ready to be brought into leadership. Personally experienced large disconnect between manger and director that ultimately led to being sent down the wrong path with out help for many months of frustration.",
