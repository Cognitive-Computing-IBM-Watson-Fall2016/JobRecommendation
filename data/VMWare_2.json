        "cons": "- No, Zero professional growth, even though the recent company-wide employee survey pointed out the same, lack of growth, development and learning opportunities for existing employees, no steps have been taken to rectify the situation, and its been 6 months.- There was a directed effort to grow the leadership and management team at VMware over last two years but rightfully or unjust-fully, all the revamping i\u2026\u00a0n the upper-echelons have the company has come from outside VMware, which has further encouraged the new managers to bring their partners-in-crime from outside VMware. This demonstrated a culture and Executive management support for hiring talent from outside then promoting from within or growing the internal employee pool in any way.- Your experience in engineering depends on the team you work for as nothing is uniform company-wide, even the coding conventions, tools and the culture from team to team(or Business Unit-Business Unit) can be drastically different. Moving between teams can seem like working for 2 very different companies with different cultures.- Stock-based compensation is hugely allocated to top-echelons of the company, and with the recent increase in Directors, Senior Directors & VPs, rank & file employees can only expect \"token\" stock based compensation, if any at all.- VMware has strong portfolio and product roadmap, but all the innovations on the roadmap were created few years ago, with recent brain-drain in engineering, it remains to be seen if VMware will be able to maintain its market leadership, as the company tries reduce its R&D spend( due to Board of Directory mandate to realize operational efficiency in R&D) and at the same continues to loose rock-star engineers as VMware IPO stock option grants are expiring.",
        "advice": "- Shuffle middle-management around the company, something the Server BU, has recently done, this will create a cohesive \"VMware\" culture across the company. Will also provide exposure to other VMware businesses.- Act on growth and development on employees before its so late that the \"brain-drain\" cannot be reversed, sitting on company-wide survey for 6 months without acting ought to be unacceptable to Board o\u2026\u00a0f Directors. Especially for an employee survey that was delayed by Executive management for last 2 years.- A lot of start-up acquisition are poorly integrated on engineering & culture side, all M&A integration effort is focussed on business & sales integration primarily. This needs to be addressed as VMware will perform more acquisition for inorganic growth.- The calibre of newly acquired company's employees is below traditional core VMware engineering employee standard and titles are usually inflated, this is going to be detrimental to VMware in the future.",

That founding CEO was replaced with a new CEO that could offer a vision for the future, but no plan to execute on it (nor a plan to \"re-green\" people, probably because he came from Seattle and wasn't used to the high degree of mobility offered by Silicon Valley). He also couldn't be bothered with running a c\u2026\u00a0ompany and hired others to do it. In 2012 VMware spent $1.25B on Nicira, in effect buying back some of the people that left in or before 2011. Shortly after he resigned at his 4 year anniversary and cashed out $26M in equity--since Nicira was funded in part by his predecessor that suggests he didn't have a superior vision after all.His replacement (the current CEO) is more geared towards running a company but hasn't done much from a leadership perspective besides jettison the web companies that VMware acquired under his predecessor's leadership. In the meantime R&D has continued to bleed the little talent it has left while replacing them with lesser talent (at least when permitted by headcount restrictions), thus resulting in yet another big software company that has a lot of people who know little and accomplish even less. This 2011 bleed likely contributed to vSphere 5.1 being the \"Windows Vista\" of virtualization releases, and it's likely to contribute to the next release being the equivalent of \"Windows 8\". The \"Principle Engineers\" that remain are less ambitious and don't seem to do much (and certainly don't set a good example or tone for the rest of R&D). The company has taken various surveys to find out how unhappy people are but never took any steps to determine the underlying reasons why or address them. The newer hires try to deal with the post-apocalyptic R&D that offers little in terms of guidance, a high count of bugs to fix and burdensome processes that have been put in place to try to avoid bad code check-ins.",
        "advice": "It's too late to correct what happened in 2011. Reassess what the company is now capable of accomplishing in a year and adjust accordingly. Keep track of what's going on. There's now a significant culture where lower management won't report a problem to upper management unless/until an answer or solution is known. This means you hear about the smaller issues but won't hear about the big problems until it's too late a\u2026\u00a0nd the most you can do is fire people. Swallow your pride and reconsider whether certain software releases should still happen. Try walking around campus and randomly pick a few meetings to sit in to assess whether people are being productive and working on stuff that matters or just busywork and politics.",
        "pros": "By working in R&D you get insight into how a computer works. There's a diverse array of software to work on, from low-level coding to UIs to website development.

Re-implemented weekends for everyone. Started taking away perks. Implemented some insane procedural pol\u2026\u00a0icies and changes to the ticketing system I would be embarrassed to call a pre beta against the better judgement of virtually everyone that has to actually use it. Announced a reorg saying that there were no plans to move positions to other countries.

But the cultural values in marketing communications, where I spent my days, are quantity and speed vs. quality of work and smart thinking. VMware seems to have a knack for hiring marketing people at the manager and director level who wouldn't know quality design or writing if they trippe\u2026\u00a0d over it -- which they don't often do, and sadly, they don't really care. Suggestions that would improve someone's pet project or initiative are routinely ignored. People get favored and promoted owing to political skills more than anything else.

        "cons": "Unfortunately despite all of the Pros I listed, the cons outweigh them for me, unfortunately.I'll be leaving within the month.In a nutshell there is a HUGE management problem at VMware. I've only started in the past 6 months so I came in with what I like to think is a fresh perspective. If you can, scroll through the past Glassdoor reviews and look for one titled \u201cLooking back, VMware has some major p\u2026\u00a0roblems\u201d from November, 2014. It turned out to be very, very prescient for me. I remember reading it before I started and thinking, \"well, that's interesting.\" It hits the nail so squarely on the head it's a bit eery.To summarize and add my own color to that review: There is a huge disconnect between the various levels of management at VMware and what you get from one high-level VP, may not match what the Director says, which may not match what your manager says.Very regularly I will have a Sr Director or VP bypass my own leader (a Director) and give me completely different priorities and instructions. You end up in a situation where you're damned if you do and damned if you don't. And, just like in the movie Office Space, you find yourself telling the same thing to 3 different managers who are asking you to fill out your TPS reports correctly. I'm an engineering manager, my job is mostly spent sorting out politics and not leading a team of capable engineers.Ultimately the problem really affects the individual contributors, the folks that really make it happen, who are left to sort out the mess. Not surprisingly, folks get and frustrated and leave. The turn-over rate, at least in my group, is depressing.It's impossible to retain the top talent that VMware desperately needs to stay relevant as the technology they've built the whole business on is quickly changing (containers, Amazon, etc). There are two main camps (maybe three) of folks who seem to stick it out:(A) Those who are afraid to go outside of VMware because this is all they've become jaded and complacent. This has become all they know. The tell tale sign is you see them shopping online all day, reading facebook, etc.(B) Those on visas or something similar from India/China/etc who don't have an easy path to moving to somewhere else or are only aware of this sort of big company culture.(C) The third camp of folks is the highest level executives, who are quite polished as you'd expect, they stick it out because they're not really exposed to what's going on at the lower levels and are likely oblivious, or don't really care. This is just a notch in their belt before they move on to their next executive position.At the end of the day you're left with people who feel stuck (and are driven like rented mules to make up for the lack of quality engineers, eg working harder versus smarter) as they watch brief gusts of fresh air come by (new, smart, intelligent engineers) that quickly evacuate as soon as they get a hold of how things operate.It's a shame really. :-( I was so excited to be at VMware but it's time to go after only 6 months.",
        "advice": "The much alluded to EPIC2 values are great, but they're only meaningful/useful if they're followed and folks buy into them. I think there should be mandatory training for managers that they participate in at the time of their hiring and that gets re-upped every 2 years or something similar.",
        "pros": "At the most basic level VMware really takes care of its employees. There are relatively few companies that can match what VMware offers with respect to standard and non-standard benefits. If you're good at what you do and are in a high-demand area you'll be rewarded with a very generous salary, bonus, and stock grants. The health benefits, vacation time, and access to high quality training, among other benefits, are \u2026\u00a0truly top notch. There are little things too, like assistance with medical costs for those having trouble conceiving. I love VMware for this type of stuff. Additionally, the Palo Alto campus where I'm located is truly in a league of its own. Anything you could possibly want, it's here. You want a top notch gym. It's here. Multiple cafeterias with various food types? It's here. On site dental and medical care? It's here. Pinball machines? Ping pong tables? Volley ball courts? All here. The list could go on.
