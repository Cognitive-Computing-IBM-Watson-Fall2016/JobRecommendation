        "cons": "Work was not challenging or interesting enough. A lot of code that is just doing routine things. It is not just Microsoft, however, it is necessary by the nature of the work. I am just not so much of an engineer, my background is in math and theoretical computer science, so I enjoy interesting things where you have to think, not just seeing technology work.You have to be excited about your work. You do not ha\u2026\u00a0ve to work 14 hours a day (or even 10, really), but you do have to be excited and want to learn new technology, get a better developer (or a better Microsoft developer, more specifically) or getter tester, or manager, etc. This may seem like a good thing (and it really is!) --- but this is also somewhat forced. You have to identify where you want to grow (when you work there full-time) in a written form, then the company will help you - coach you, move you to another project, etc. You cannot just say \"I just want to work here for my 40 hours and get paid\". You have to find out yourself what you want to do. You have to load yourself with work, come up with new ideas, take the initiative, etc. This is required. So they are requiring and taking some of your emotional or spiritual energy in this way.Too much admiration for Microsoft. Gets annoying to see all those monitors and posters and emails, advertising, how happy is everyone is at Microsoft. Even though it is not far from truth, a lot of people are very happy and very excited from working there.... - but this also gets annoying. Seriously, I cannot stand some many people claiming to be excited about their work every day, everyone from smiling drivers of the shuttle cars on campus to those working in the cafeteria, to researchers, developers, managers... It looks too good to be true, made me feel uncomfortable.During my internship I was not given enough information on what was expected of me. It took me some time to understand that people just expected me to take the initiative. For example, they may not tell you \"you have to do it by next Friday\" --- but you will have to ask \"what do I have to do and by which date?\" If you don't, they will think you don't know what's going on (because you don't care to ask around) so not interested, or you are not a productive worker. They will find somebody else to do the job, or the project will move slower (they have many projects; sometimes 2-3 teams, doing the same thing, so at least one can succeed :)), and you will get a not-as-great review and may be eventually asked to leave. Although, I admit, this is fair in a way. If you have the initiative, go for it.A lot of emphasis on getting the work done (which is good), but not as much on making people do what they are good at. The responsibility is totally on you. You have to figure out what you like and what you don't, what you are good at or not good at. You have to take the initiative. (Then, in many cases, you will actually be able to move to a position that you want.)Many developers, testers, etc. are, it seems, not too great in terms of their skill, as Microsoft is a big place. However, talent is always recognized, and people are always trying to get better. If your background is limited and you need to learn a lot, but Microsoft still takes you --- then prepare to work a lot, too. It may actually be a lot of hours every day. (Yet again, nobody will count, and you can do it at home.)Redmond location - there are some commute issues. Microsoft is working on that (like their \"the connector\" is a great thing), yet this will always be an issue.So-called starbucks coffee is no good, and cafeteria food is average (I have seen pretty much their best cafetereia during the on-campus interview.)",

Like, you think it might be a good idea how to improve something: signs in your building, meeting schedule, some internal rules - you send an email, and you immediately get a friendly response, and people start working on implementing your suggestion (or disucssing it) as long as you want it.Seems to be very fair for reviews, promotions, salary increases, etc.If you are invited for an on-site interview, you will get reimbursed for everything. You can negotiate another day in the hotel, negotiate where you want to fly from and to, ask for another 5 free taxi vouchers, etc. They don't care what you where for the interview (or when you work there).

If your project goes into crunch mode for the longterm, you could find yourself stuck with 80 hour weeks and no alternative other than to do them or leave the company, because there are ways to hold you on your team if they don't want to let you leave (related to: wrong manager)3. No raises without a promo, I hear, currently4. Jobs can be \u2026\u00a0so narrow, and involve so much administrative overhead, that you spend a lot of your time on work that doesn't enhance your skill set or make you more employable elsewhere in the future5. The company's spending money on what seem to be money-sinks right now, which is good if you want to get into a money-sink team with a fancy title and leave it in a couple years for another company, but not necessarily good for the long term6. Don't say you were not warned: the same job can be titled and compensated very differently depending on the organization. In general, money-sink groups like search and Xbox tend to offer better compensation than bread-and-butter established groups like servers, Windows client, and Office.7. Even if you carefully select a team to join based on its manager, which is the recommended way to do it at MS (choose manager first, then job), this can get up-ended by a divisional or departmental reorganization that can give you a manager that is not a good fit for you and there's not much you can do about it",
        "advice": "Invest in your successful franchises. They're still going to be bringing money in for years to come. Instead you're IE'ing them, and ignoring them figuring that you don't NEED to spend money on them.

        "pros": "1. With the right manager, you have access to potentially life-changing career advancement opportunities2. In some groups, you have the chance to work with people who are the best in the industry3. If you've got a family and want free insurance coverage for the whole brood, MS is the place for you4. Casual-dress culture and the tradition that still endures of periodic \"morale events\" for teams is nice\u2026\u00a05. If you're in the right position in the right group, you can get exposure to Microsoft business expertise (even if you're in a technical discipline) that will stand you in great stead in the future",

        "cons": "But it's not all rosy. There are certainly a lot of things to be aware of, if you have never worked at Microsoft.When I joined, I was surprised by a few things about the organization:1) It's true that promotions are hard to come by. You could go on for years with pretty good annual reviews but still not be promoted for various reasons. This is incredibly frustrating and had I known this earlier, I wou\u2026\u00a0ld have done more then rather than to learn it after several years. But I believe it takes a certain type of person. You need to know how to manage upwards extremely well. Talk to your manager. Be firm about what you want and when. Be incredibly focused on what moves the needle. And have great impact and influence on others. It's easy to be distracted on other things.2) It takes a long time to get things done. Because it's such a large organization, great ideas take time to cultivate and turn into solid strategy, priorities, and action items. There are so many people to get buy-in from. But if you build the relationships and understand how the system works, you learn to factor that into your daily work and projects. If you come from an entrepreneurial background and you are used to doing things quickly or on a whim to test out, etc, then I would caution you to think hard about this. Get used to simple things sometimes taking months to complete.3) There are a lot of managers here who don't do a good job of balancing both their individual contributions with their managerial responsibilities. It's definitely hard because a manager wants their team to perform well but they also want to contribute directly to the organization's success. Balancing this effectively is hard and few do it very well.",
        "advice": "I hope that management will learn to cultivate better managers and empower managers to find creative ways to recognize employees more frequently. Also, due to the various divisions at Microsoft, collaboration ACROSS divisions can be very hard, despite the consequences on our business that exist if collaboration doesn't occur.",
        "pros": "This perspective is from the Online Services Division, specifically the ad platform teams.Similar to many other reviews, it is nice that we have beautiful offices, pretty decent compensation (more on this later), and super smart people.Unlike many other divisions, Microsoft is not the dominant force in this particular industry. So the varied stereotypes of a \"monopolistic Microsoft\" or \"large company \u2026\u00a0intent on a closed software system\" here, do not necessarily hold true. You can see that in conversations with customers. They want us to do well. They want us to be a strong, viable competitor to the other big players in the online advertising industry. This is a huge plus when it comes to the willingness of customers to work with us, especially given our big name. It also manifests in a strong focus and collaboration among the dedicated engineering, business group and sales teams. It's a pro in the sense that the advertising business needs to be an open ecosystem and that is refreshing if you've never worked here before.One other pro that I'll mention is the fact that there is incredible talent in the strategy teams. There's a ton of great strategic work going on here that you can get behind and use as your north star. Knowing that executives are working hard to make sure we're well-positioned in the industry makes the work all the more worthwhile. That determination is clear throughout the organization.",
