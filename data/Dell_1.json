Everyone is expected to work long hour\u2026\u00a0s and weekends---then head home and work on email. All companies demand long hours from their workers, but one major difference at Dell is that people spend all this time working on valueless activities just because some exec or manager said so.The leadership is terrible with no clear direction and strategy. The company is in a death seizure, where it is flopping from one strategy to the next. The company is controlled from the top and has hired very few good leaders and a work force that only knows how to take orders. This creates only ideas that are \"me too\", where Dell has become a company that only copies others---now both in process and product.The company is really broken from all sides. The infrastructure (IT, Phone, SW) has been underfunded and neglected. The workforce moral is terrible and the leadership (and pipeline) are completely inept.

All of these people are riding\u2026\u00a0 on the backs of a few smart engineers who are doing all the work!There are a few brilliant engineers within engineering/development/support that are literally holding the entire company up. My guess is these engineers are just here to learn and will move on to better things eventually in which case Force10 will really be in trouble. Some advice for Dell is to take control - get rid of bloated management immediately - especially the management who have no technical knowledge; they are just a waste. I know of one director in one of the technical departments that doesn't even know what a router is. Wow!!!!! is all I can say!

The company is located in the heart of Silicon Valley right by other networking giants like Cisco and Brocad\u2026\u00a0e.

        "cons": "Dell has been adding \"services\" to their hardware/software mix for some time. In layman's terms this means call centers/customer service help desks for outside clients, some quite large. With over 20 years of exemplary work in various facets of IT, I was a casualty of the recession and was hired by the first company I applied to, Dell. I had never worked in a call center environment before and hoped for the best but \u2026\u00a0I was not prepared for the actuality.Every call center stereotype you may have heard of is there: literally chained to a 3x6 desk by a headset; calls, breaks and lunches timed to the millisecond; absolutely no privacy as you are only separated from your co-worker by an 8\" divider; very often no time to breathe between calls, etc. There are agents who concentrate on email/web inquiries instead of the phones and that is seen as a perk and is relative heaven compared to the phone agents' world, but a web ticketer may still be tossed into the phone mix when they are short-staffed; even if not trained in that realm they are still audited/graded on the same standard as normal phone agents. Standards/requirements can change on a daily basis, making something that was correct one day be counted off for the next. We are required to have several certifications and even a year later a large minority of co-workers still do not have them yet they are still around.Actual competence is not rewarded but sticking as close to the metrics as possible is. Innovation/real world experience from the few \"adults\" on the floor who seek to improve processes is not sought out nor appreciated. Mandatory overtime is required more than most would like. A cursory walk along the building will show desks with jackets, blankets and gloves worn by agents trying to stay warm year-round due to wacky climate control.One changes schedules, managers and tier 2 agents every three months which doesn't give one much time to build a relationship with someone who will champion you. Audits are handled by tier 2 agents who can either stick to the letter of the law or give out blanket top scores depending on who it is; their rankings are affected by how good/bad their agents' scores are and some pad the results while some are so hyper-critical one cannot compete fairly with the fluffed-up ones. As a person who strives for perfection and fairness, this disparity upsets me to no end. After bringing up examples of this to management ad nauseum, nothing changes and I am finding myself worn down from trying and from even caring. Anecdotally, with rare exception, all managers and tier 2 agents are married males, under 35 with small children. Take that as you will.To be fair to Dell, this is probably how all large call centers are run; agents are numbers, metrics and rankings. In a company of over 100,000, how much is one person going to matter? This is not an atmosphere for anyone who has ever held a real career-type job where one is treated like an adult, allowed to think and contribute. It will kill any enthusiasm you hold for doing an excellent job and it will kill your spirit. If quality of work life means anything to you, don't be lulled by the (sadly) decent wages by today's standards; keep looking. And if you are over 40, RUN!",
        "advice": "Realize that even some lowly customer services agents may have experience worth utilizing. Some of us only landed at Dell because of the recession yet bring years, sometimes decades, of experience that is being squelched and in turn the professional pride you hope to engender in your employees dies instead.",
        "pros": "Dell offers an above average benefits package, (surprisingly) higher pay than others for similar work and does walk their \"diversity talk\", at least as far as hiring goes.

Casual dress is taken to a pretty liberal degree, especially in the summer.This is a good first step in the IT field for someone right out of school and for someone who wants to be \"molded\" into a company's image.
