After those hours, a compelling reason for absence is okay, as long is it happens infrequently and nothing bad happens when you're away.In 4.5 years, I never saw anybody get a raise better than the real inflation rate. For the people managers love (which seems to have little to do with performance), they get 3%. Mana\u2026\u00a0gers there love people that will not speak up when given impossible tasks or when told blatant lies. Managers all manage up, meaning they want you to say you are on top of everything so they can go back to their meetings. When something falls through the cracks, they want to be able to say you didn't ask for help. They do not want you to actually ask for help, and if you do they will burn your time up justifying what you've been doing every minute, but they never take anything off your task list.The few Managers I saw that actually spent time trying to help their team get their jobs done were laid off or demoted. Everything new that is rolled out is presented with the punishments for not complying. I never saw a new initiative or process rolled out with rewards or positive encouragement. Every failure, even mechanical breakdowns like welds breaking, are viewed as personal discipline issues because a good engineer knows the condition of all their systems. If you asked to upgrade the system and got turned down, the failure is your fault because you didn't specify when and how it was going to fail, and you didn't re-submit your request with better justification.I had an alarm that went unattended for 2 hours and caused a problem. One root cause was that they just laid off 2 of the 3 job positions that were supposed to respond to the alarm and hadn't figured out a backfill plan yet (normally 3 job positions are all supposed to make sure the alarms are handled). Two of the three were laid off, the ops tech was busy repairing other broken equipment, and the managers at the incident review rejected those root causes. The only root cause accepted was the ops tech thought the alarm was not critical and took two hours to respond. The solution adopted was to change the alarm message to sound more critical.I've worked for many companies, and I've never seen a place where deception by omission is the only way to keep your job.",

While none of my managers were malicious, their net effect was categorically abusive. I simultaneously had a skillset that was too critical to my server project to allow me to take an offered SoC \"Hot Job\" (jobs identified as critical for the company's future), but not worthy enough to address the career g\u2026\u00a0rowth reasons for my dissatisfaction with the project that led me to want to leave, but they still offered me nearly half a years pay to voluntarily separate from the company to make space to hire more engineers for SoC. Let that sink in - I had been offered an SoC-related engineering job and my group blocked my transfer then offered me a large buyout to leave the company because they needed to make room to hire SoC engineers. Again, nobody was being malicious here, but I was in the middle of three different ridiculous circumstances caused by decision of three different levels of management all acting in what, at some level, was the most rational thing for them to do. At no point did anybody stand up to say \"the company is paying a good engineer we could use in SoC to leave the company. That doesn't seem right.\"Intel will tell you largely and loudly about how much they value the people working there, but they have erected systemic barriers that allow pathological levels of cruelty towards these same people. Intel will shout until they are Intel-blue-in-the-face that they have these wonderful systems for recognizing and rewarding accomplishments, but they're very inconsistent in their use. I worked on my own time for two years creating an architectural firmware debugging GUI tool. After it was announced that I was leaving, architects and engineers from different teams and different projects popped up to make sure that the source code would be available once I was gone. Over 400 hours of my own time creating it, other engineers apparently thinking that preservation of the source for it was of paramount importance, yet it was never deemed enough of an accomplishment for either recognition or reward. I can think of few more stinging ways to wound a departing engineer. When the buyout offer was extended to everyone, 5 acceptees were asked to delay their departure because their skills were needed badly. I was one of those 5 and to this day one of my greatest regrets of my 8 years at Intel was agreeing to it.I offer this example for illustrative purposes to demonstrate the dysfunctional connection between Intel's intentions, and Intel's actions. That last tool was not the first time I had identified a need, spent my own time providing a solution, had the tool picked up by many other engineers but received no notice from management until I moved on -- it was the third. The problem is systemic with deep roots. It also isn't why I left. I left because my career growth was dependent on the cooperation of a junior engineer who was getting rewarded with annual review bullet points for non-cooperation.",

When the auto-generated emails from Taleo started arriving, his first question to me was: \"what can we do to keep you here?\" Apparently he didn't actually know my concerns. He pleaded with me to wait just a little longer before accepting anything, which I did. When the server group GM enabled management to block transfers for 6 months, all such pleading stopped. Are you listening to your direct reports? Do you know what they're working on? Do you recognize when they go the extra mile for the project? Do you confront conflict between engineers constructively or do you ignore it and tell them to \"deal with it\"? Is the best tool in your belt the ability to delay dealing with a report's concerns until you can argue that addressing something that far in the past would do more harm than good?

I sat in many meetings where the audience typed furiously on their laptops or snored loudly over the conference call during the presentation, giving 0 cares, or they pigeon-holed on a completely unrelated topic that delayed crucial decision-making. Everything at Intel felt like it moved slowly, bogged down by tradition and its resulting band-aid fixes/decisions.I also encountered serious issue with the company's management selection scheme. Managers seemed to be chosen based on how long they've been at Intel or what's on their outdated resume, rather than their demonstrated merits and character. When respected colleagues approached my manager requesting to change projects due to consistent sexist and demeaning comments made by the project manager, they were immediately told to quit whining or start looking for new jobs. When I approached my manager with concern that I felt unchallenged, was not experiencing growth, and reaching my potential, he told me that I shouldn't worry since learning the organization chart and how the different business units interacted with each other was still a major achievement....

More than a few people quit or transferred because of other people's poorly-planned sabbaticals. On the other hand, some people at Intel are so useless, you don't even notice that they're gone until their cube is decorated for their return. It is very much a secret society; if y\u2026\u00a0ou are liked by everyone, you will work there forever. If you are disliked, you will find yourself in redeployment regardless of how much of a rock star you are. The technology at Intel (and the IT department in general) is ironically bland, old, and limited. You will not be working with cutting edge technology at Intel unless you're directly involved with creating it. There is shockingly little innovation at the company because whenever a new problem arises or a new business idea is funded, they put the same old grey ghosts in charge of it. If your previous job was at a tech startup, Intel will feel like Soviet Russia to you -- big, cold, slow, mundane, hostile toward change, dominated by senseless rules and old traditions, secretly pleased with the failure of new initiatives, and governed by oligarchs. Most people are decent, but some people are untouchable and they know it: many 10k and 100k managers, architects, and everyone above them. They are free to do and say whatever they want, they can and will flagrantly disobey rules and disregard standards, and they can eliminate your budget, cancel your project, or even force you into redeployment or resignation if you really stand in the way. If you want to make a difference, do not go to Intel. Do not expect to be employed long-term unless you are working on a product that is actively making a ton of money for the company.

There aren't layoffs in the traditional sense; instead, Intel will offer voluntary separation agreements (big severa\u2026\u00a0nce check) or redeployment (you can still get paid while you desperately apply for other positions within Intel, and are given priority hiring status). Most people at the company are pleasant and professional (some are NOT; see the cons section for details). If you play your cards right, you can coast here for 30+ years and get a marvelous retirement at the end.

I happen to work in MCG (mobile communication group) that throughout my time (3.5 year) was reorganized 6 times(!). Many times the multi-month work of whole department (not only my team) was thrashed, because some new boss would come and \"not favor\" your team \u2026\u00a0and whatever result was done to that date.Global cross-team coordination effort was very low to non-existent. Teams would \"fight\" for resources, and have a quite unhealthy competition. Decision would be made with some irrelevant considerations, and forced down to my team.As result, the culture actually experienced would not be really engaging.The performance review process is essentially botched. Some much higher management essentially issues a quota on number of good performance ratings to your team. Then, you end up in a situation when no matter how much you tried, you'd be stuck at your performance grade, because no good rating can be made available to you (again despite the acknowledgement of high level of contribution and such). Example: our team received only one EE (exceeds expectations) rating, and my manager decided to use it to promote one particular employee (citing his family situation (he had a new child, etc), and his current lower grade). Others were given S (satisfactory) rating",

I traveled 2-3 times a year being in an engineering role.Some good positive aspects of the culture - Intel has a \"work-week\" (WW) based schedule\u2026\u00a0 (simpler to learn and more efficient), it at least declares a lot of good intentions (but in practice you may find a different picture), all kind of training is available to employees (a lot of mandatory programs).Intel has plenty of relationships in the industry. My team ended up facing customers in \"deep technical dive\" support programs, I got to work with all big industry names: Samsung, Asus, HP, Dell, Sharp, Sony, to name a few.",

The moral of Intel employees is down and there is no job security - Therefore, employees are not performing at their best. Management group is very \"clicky\" - they hire their friends and help them get into Mgmt by giving them top job reviews - but no one dares say anything because even though the feedback says \"confidential\" they are not - and once you get on the bad side of one manager, you are sunk. If you do a job really well and then want to move to a different position, your direct manager has complete control of your carrier development and may keep you on one role for as long as they want. Focal (yearly job reviews) are a joke... they have to be written by the employee in third person because managers are to lazy to write them and no matter how long you spend or how good you have sold yourself, the manager will still give top reviews to their preferred employees. Standard pay raises are between 0 and 3% per year - as of recent, pay raises average about 1%, since the corporation is going through financial stress - a 1% pay raise does not even cover the increase of cost of living.Is it a good place to work?
