That's created an above average level of churn, which really cuts out a lot of momentum towards changes.I also think Yahoo! can be a bit hidebound at times, depending on the mana\u2026\u00a0gement above you. Sometimes shipping a lite version is better market insight than a market study.",

        "cons": "Obviously, Yahoo is having a tough time increasing it's revenue. While other Internet companies are growing, Yahoo is struggling to grow. It's revenue is heavily dependent on display advertising which was hit hard ever since the economy began a recession around 2008. The hostile takeover attempt by Microsoft also created divisions within the company and many talented employees left as a result .Prior to 2008,\u2026\u00a0 I became frustrated that Yahoo wasn't aggressive in seeking new growth opportunities. (In particular, I always wondered where was Yahoo's version of AdSense. It exists today, but is not competitive.) I wanted Yahoo to kick ass. I wanted to be part of a winning team. But in the end, I felt like I was playing for a 2nd or 3rd place team. In Silicon Valley, if you're a decent software engineer it's not difficult to find a new job. Thus I decided to move on from Yahoo.",
        "advice": "Aggressively seek out new markets. Expand and don't focus on contracting (layoffs). Growth is the way to succeed. Rely less on advertising as a source of revenue.

Just make sure that paid services surpasses advertising as the main source of revenue.",

The scale at which Yahoo \u2026\u00a0operates is very large (still one of the biggest websites in the world) and that means there are cool problems to solve (i.e. what is a good data store for holding 500 million user accounts?
