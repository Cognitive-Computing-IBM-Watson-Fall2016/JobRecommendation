If you are new and trying to figure things out, no one will help you. You are expected to learn everything by yourself. Intel also has a habit of taking H1-B visa students who recently graduated and overworking them as much as possible. If you are a new graduate, do not come to Int\u2026\u00a0el. There are much better companies.As a process engineer, work/life balance is non-existent. Process Engineers are on-call 24 hours per day, and it is very common to receive phone calls at 3 am. Intel refuses to hire shift engineers. The Rio Rancho plant is also being downsized, and 10% of the work force will be laid off in the fall of 2013.Intel claims that it has a 2 year lead on its competitors, but that's a lie. If Intel had a 2 year lead, why would they need to lay off 10% of their work force in Rio Rancho? If they had a 2 year lead, why are their chip sales 5% lower in 2013 compared to 2012? The reality is that Samsung and TSMC are dominating Intel in the cell phone and tablet markets. Intel has focused too much on laptops and PCs, and they have ignored cell phones and tablets. Now, Intel is 10 years behind in cell phones and tablets, and they refuse to consider new ideas, such as licensing their designs to third parties or making chips that aren't based on x86 architecture.If you are considering working at Intel, pay attention to what is happening right now. Intel does not have a realistic 10 year plan. I would not be surprised if Intel lays off more people within 10 years. Intel is shrinking, not growing. Intel is simply not adapting to changes fast enough, and upper management refuses to consider making changes to Intel's business philosophy.",
