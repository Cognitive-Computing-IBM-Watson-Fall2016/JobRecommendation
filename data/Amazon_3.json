        "cons": "Pay: Amazon doesn't pay especially well in terms of salary. They have \"total compensation\" which probably includes two years' of cash bonuses after your start date and a package of RSUs which really don't start vesting for two years. My \"total compensation\" was $10K higher than my salary, which isn't bad but leaves you at the mercy of the stock price. Advancement is slow; aside from a nominal COLA-like raise once a y\u2026\u00a0ear after reviews, it can take a few years to get promoted a single level within the company, and even then the raise may not be that impressive. Basically what it comes down to is, your salary when you enter the company largely determines what your salary will be during your career there; they're mostly going to reward you with RSUs, not raises, which are really intended to keep you at the company longer.Advancement: This is a complete mystery to everyone involved. Three-plus years and I never figured it out, except that it has to do mostly with your direct manager. They're responsible for representing you in the process, so a sleazy manager who promotes you heavily is good to have a review time, but a disinterested one or a bad communicator will basically leave you hanging. Sadly, in my experience, this is how advancement and reviews work at Amazon; they don't have much to do with the quality of the work at all.Management: Management is totally mixed at Amazon; some are great, some are terrible (in my experience MBAs are let run amok, and seem primarily to promote one another, at least in my group--we had a bunch from the same school). Some people get micromanaged, some are left to their own devices. As a matter or practice, Amazon hates managing people--most managers have no more than three or four direct reports, so there's a lot of mixing things up on teams: senior employers get one employee stuck under them and that sort of thing. That's one of the main reasons the experience of management can be so mixed--there's so many people managers who may or may not actually be assigning you work that it becomes a matter of personality.Environment: The workplace is weird at Amazon--it's aggressive for sure, but not exactly a boys' club, so that's a plus. It is a very accepting of diversity place to work. But overall, there's a lot of confusion. They're constantly shifting levels of management, and theoretically everyone \"owns\" a core set of tasks or products or whatever, and there are channels that are supposed to be used to communicate with other owners and teams (\"up and over\"); in practice, this rarely if ever works, and if you want to be successful you have to friendly, reliable, and willing to take on other tasks for other people and work constructively with others, because frequently employees simply get together to solve simple, short-term problems and completely circumvent management (who prefer to have lots of agenda-less meetings to deal with problems). In that sense, Amazon is an extremely political place to work, because you constant risk stepping on someone's toes, crossing an unseen boundary, or things like that. If you're not a communicator or not friendly, this may not be the place for you. It's also a company that's basically relentlessly positive--it's typically bad for you to \"go negative.\" They don't like to blame individuals for problems; even big issues are typically dealt with with a meeting where all the stakeholders get together and divvy up blame so that no one's left with all the responsibility. In a lot of ways this is good, but by the same token people's unwillingness to risk seeming negative creates an environment where there's a lot of evasion and frequently an inability to hold poor performers accountable for their work, particularly if they're gifted at skewing metrics in their favor. Remember, it's a political place to work, and if you can't explain something to a manager in a Blackberry-friendly format, they simply do not care to learn.Career Development: Aside from the fact you'll get great experience, learn a lot, and have a great thing to put on your resume, Amazon is a horrible company for career development. Lots of people leave after only a couple years. The weak pay scale means that you can get paid more with the experience you get there, while Amazon is largely incapable of communicating anything about career development that's useful. There's lots of talk about it at review time, but no follow through. There's virtually no internal career development opportunities, especially if you're not a developer. That said, it is a company that invites moving around internally. After one year, you're free to look for other positions in the company, and most employees are perfectly happy to sit down for lunch with you and discuss what goes into their job and what their team's looking for. So basically you have to network the rest of the company if you want to get anywhere, but be aware--changing jobs does not by any means equal pay raises or advancement.",
        "advice": "The divide between senior management and the people doing the work below is a gaping chasm. The company really likes to believe that Amazon has a horizontal rather than vertical structure--that there aren't a lot of levels of management. In practice, this is sort of true, but you will rarely if ever deal with your team leader's boss at Amazon. There may not be a lot of layers of management, but it's definitely strati\u2026\u00a0fied. Having been at the bottom of the chain, I saw quite a lot of brown-nosing going up the chain--frequently managers would work long and hard to produce theoretically objective reports and metrics that obscured complex problems. Surprisingly, in the management, there's a real opposition to complexity. If it's not possible to put in a Blackberry-friendly email format, they honestly don't seem to care about it until it blows up in their face.",
        "pros": "In a lot of ways, Amazon's weaknesses are great reasons to work there. It's a frequently disorganized company that does high tech work on a discount retailer's margins, so there's plenty of opportunity to take on complex tasks, self-initiate projects, drive them to completion, and work across groups. One thing that's basically guaranteed is that your job description doesn't cover everything you will have to do, or wi\u2026\u00a0ll have the opportunity to do. Also, it's fairly hard to get hired there--their interviewing process is nightmarish--so you do get to work with some very smart people once you're on the inside, and have great opportunities to create new products and drive concrete solutions to complex problems. At the very least, it is a very creative environment.Once inside the company, you also have a lot of opportunity to change rolls. After a year, you're welcome to start trying to interview with different teams for new positions, and there is even the opportunity to move overseas for short-term assignments.",

Just when you think you've made a difference by performing 15 different tasks to accomplish a goal (10 of which were not really yours to do, but you did them because there was no one else to pick it up), everything shifts in frequent re-orgs. Resources are lost, roadmaps change dramatically, \u2026\u00a0documentation is poor to non-existent, which causes lost momentum that sucks the life out of you.The lack of processes and routines. This is not true for 100% of the company, but is for many areas that one would think a company of 10+ years would have nailed. The constant reorganization of teams and leaders breaks any continuity that was established prior to the reorg. I was dumbfounded when I learned that a certain team in the company had absolutely no idea of the steps it took to issue a payment to a supplier. I think they thought it was all black magic. Project processes were another area that some key development teams made up as they went and changed quarterly. This created loads of knee-jerk reactions for many teams impacted across the company and challenged goodwill with internal relationships.HR could care less about employees. Loads of lip service from the HR teams to make you think they care. Like many other groups in the company, their individual teams don't seem to talk to one another, or know each other for that matter. It is as if each team has blinders on and they only know and perform only their function in strict confines. There is lots of \"that's not my job\" attitudes. As an example, I witnessed on more than one occasion where great performers took international assignments only to return to leave the company because the company did nothing to help reintegrate the employees. What I heard is that HR managers and recruiters did nothing to assist these employees returning from their assignments, each one saying it was not their job. It was left to the employee to figure it out themselves. So after the company spends tens of thousands of dollars to move staff around the world yet the company expects nothing in return? How dumb is that?Below market pay. Amazon is known for paying below market in terms of base salary yet expects people to work at least 50 hours per week. Many teams due to them being lean require 60+ hours a week. HR sells the entire compensation package with stock which can be great in a up market and if you live in the US. The odd thing is the mixed message they send with it: the stock makes you an owner of the company but because they call it comp, they expect you to sell each time you vest. I would rather have a larger base pay.Amazon is no different than other companies in that it has it's own dysfunctions. If you have an iron will and a high tolerance for stress, you will do well there. Use the company as much as it uses you and it will be a happy relationship.",

It is not uncommon that managers will say that you should spend time with your families, but give you so much work that makes it almost impossible. Additionally there is little room for errors, even if you have had years of recognized achievements, a couple of months of bad luck and your thrown to the dogs.I do have to clarify it is not like this in all departments.

The basic principle that the company was built on which by driving lower prices it can fuel sales, gain leverage and reduce costs from vendors to further reduce prices fuel growth, etc. is brilliant due to its simplicity.

This also leads to plenty opportunities for innovation, which are key in creating a sustainable business.Another pro is the fact that the company focuses on three things that do not change no matter what the economy does: great prices, great selection, great customer experience. No matter what the state of external elements might be, focusing on these three things gives a company an edge.Finally its obsession with customer satisfaction is a lesson to be learned.

We are interviewing people that we passed on years ago because we have let people go that were better then them\u2026\u00a0. Those people will be let go in less than 2 years and it will cost the company a lot of time and money. Some of the great people that were let go should be hired back over the candidates that are available now.2) People are miserable because of #1. They feel like it is only a matter of time before they are let go no matter how hard they work and how good they are. Truly a toxic environment where people are being paralyzed by feer. This is not what Jeff intended.3) Management that is excelling and moving up are the ones that operate best in this environment and play the political game. Move to a new area. Lop off a bunch of heads (of good people) and say that you have raised the bar when in fact all you have done is create chaos and fear and actually slowed down the company from becoming the greatest retailer in the world. Shame on you it will catch up to you in the long term.4) Some really great people no longer want to work here because of this enviroment and if you want to leave and go work for a company that does not treat people this way as a manager you may get type cast when in fact you do not believe in this at all.",

That means crappy initial code, poor QA and no documentation (isn\u2019t a go\u2026\u00a0od thing when you have high turnover). I can\u2019t understate how intense, stressful and unbalanced the work-life is here.Amazon offers none of the extravagant benefits that other tech companies do. You get health insurance, and that\u2019s about it. (there are annual stock grants tied to your review performance, but most consider this to be part of your wage compensation). Oh, and you get a total of $100 off of Amazon sold products per year. Yippie!In addition to lacking any balance, the environment is highly politically and hierarchy-based, and filled with newbie tech managers, many of whom have no managerial skills or experience (remember the high turnover).By running the company with an anemically lean staff, paying no benefits and squeezing every bit of life out of their employees, Amazon saves money\u2026 a lot of money. So much so, that they can throw a little of it back in the form of industry leading pay rates (if you negotiate for it).
