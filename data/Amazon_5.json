This doesn't mean they necessarily get more, or less, work done. The opposite can also be true. There are many elements of 'getting lucky' when it comes to this one.It's not for everyone. If you're not able to infer from ambiguous data, rapidly lear\u2026\u00a0n new skillsets, and take on the right partners with ruthless efficiency, you will struggle. Some folks settle in to a particular role and never move up - but the unspoken policy is 'up or out'. That is to say, move up in your current role, or find a new one. This isn't inherently a bad thing, but means you need to be open to the idea of moving teams, or locations, often, if you don't end up where you wanted to be in short order.If you're someone who requires hand-holding, detailed project plans, or anything more than a somewhat ambiguous directive, you will have a very hard time here. Amazon hires smart people, gives them some concept of what they need to accomplish, and expects them to do the other 99%. That's not always a bad thing, but for some people, it's a nightmare.

This unique situation is held together by core principles that permeate all levels of the company, from the top, to the bottom.When you work here, you will have the opportunity to take on\u2026\u00a0 as many challenges as you're willing to. There are few companies, tech, or otherwise, that will allow you to have almost free reign on their systems, processes, and standards. If you have the time, in addition to the work you are mandated, you have the ability to tackle any number of increasingly complex and mind-boggling challenging puzzles to solve. These take many forms, and can be incredibly rewarding, giving you experience in areas you never thought you would have. If you are someone who doesn't need direction, is self-starting and can get things done, quickly, there is limitless ability to challenge yourself at Amazon.Some teams are situated to take off, and if you get on the right one, at the right time, and have the necessary skillset, your life will suddenly feel like it's moving quicker than it used to. Time will pass instantly, and weeks turn to months before you realize what is happening. It's an incredible experience when this happens. Both in the field, and at corporate, this type of feeling is pervasive.Plan to be stretched regardless of the role you're in. Amazon is designed in such a way that the tasks that are given to you are almost too much for you to accomplish. You will need to be creative, take on partners, design new processes, and manage your time better than you thought humanly possible before coming on. You are in charge of your own work-life balance in the sense that you must know when to say 'slow down', or risk taking on too much and miss deliverables, this is frowned upon. Many of the reviews here fail to mention the employee responsibility in understanding their own workload, and being firm enough to push-back when it's exceeded their capacity. Most managers will understand this, and help you manage your workload if it exceeds what they think you can hit. That doesn't mean you won't have a tremendous amount to do, it means you need to know when to say enough or re-prioritize what it is you are working on. There is a tendency to take on too much, and burn out, you must insulate yourself from that process.There's a huge demand here for the ability to get things done quickly and efficiently. Amazon has not fostered an academic work environment. You will need to work with the information you have, or can quickly dig up, and make incredibly powerful and critical decisions with what would otherwise be considered ambiguous information. This is where it gets tricky, the principles of 'are right a lot' could be replaced with the more common having 'good instincts'. Having good instincts is a mixture of both learning while at the company, and your skills when you come in. If you don't have good instincts, or don't trust your own judgement, you will have a very hard time at Amazon. That being said, you also have to be right, very often - or rapidly learn from your mistakes and improve. This fast, iterative, learning, is part of what makes Amazon difficult to work at, but also why employees who can hang on for some time are highly regarded and needed to keep on to keep the business from repeating prior mistakes.",
