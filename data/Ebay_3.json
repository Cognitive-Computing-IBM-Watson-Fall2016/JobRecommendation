A lot of calls require action and project time, which leadership looks down on anytime spent off calls but you're also graded on resolution.* Leadership in my department was not good at all, they were very negative reinforcement and weren't there to work with your or help you.* Nobody will help you with your develo\u2026\u00a0pment, you have to take charge of it on your own. (which could be a good or bad thing)* Lots of contradictions such as company believes \"People are generally good\" but department leadership believes \"everyone is up to no good\". Company invests a lot of time and money on each employee's training, they would rather correct poor behavior than lay off and start over, but when it actually came down to it, all team leads were letting go one (or more) person(s) from their team regardless if they have had sufficient warning.* Big corporation claims to value each employee but when it comes down to it they really don't and everyone is replaceable.* I was let go for \"excessive time offline\" but my shrink, the number that gauges the time spent offline was within an acceptable range and all offline time was legitimate time spent for customers, and I received no warnings for it so I had no idea it was unsatisfactory, until it was too late.* There are opportunities for advancement but hundreds of employees are competing with each other for those opportunities which actually makes advancement very hard to do. A lot of lateral movement between departments but very difficult to move up.* Recently they starting using \"sports\" terms for performance, you're either winning or losing, and for those people who aren't quite hitting their metrics, hearing that you are a loser isn't exactly a motivator, it is actually the opposite.

Rethink the way your team leaders lead, its very down putting and not just for me, but everyone I talk to feel very unmotivated when they speak to their team leader. The coach is a good balance because they are uplifting and motivational but not quite enough to balance out the team lead. Its a lot like b\u2026\u00a0eing sent to the principal's office in school, talking to your team lead is never a good thing, even if you are doing well because they always pinpoint what is not good or what needs to be better and they don't recognize anything good. They also all have their own system (not just styles), my last team lead was a micro-manager and he spent a big majority of his time looking over shoulders and digging to catch people doing things they aren't supposed to be doing. (he actually had a 15 minute huddle with our team to tell us that he is good at \"catching\" things and that he will catch us, its only a matter of time) Coming from a strong management background, he was everything a manger shouldn't be.",
