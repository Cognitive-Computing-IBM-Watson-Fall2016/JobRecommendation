You are making 80+ phone calls, talking for 3.5-4 hours of actual talk time, setting 5+ appointments, and pitching 2-4 businesses a day. You're not doing anything else. This classifies as a telemarketer, I'm sorry! When someone leaves their job for this \"opportunity\" it should be made very clear. If you don't do the previously mentioned metrics the\u2026\u00a0n you are made to feel like a failure. Sometimes you just may be on the phone with a really good lead who might take longer to talk then others! It happens! Although there are some good managers here, most are poorly trained and this is their ONLY experience with ad sales for the most part. You read straight from a script and management doesn't like when you ask why you are being told to say something. They barge your calls and will tell you what to say even if it's not how you prefer to talk to someone. You feel like your job is very fragile here and fear you may be fired if you're having a bad week/month. In few months of employment here, I've witnessed about 5-10 people get fired or quit.*Another thing that was bothersome was the lack of diversity here. With a New York office employing a lot of people, this shouldn't be an issue. They talk about the \"culture\" of Yelp all the time. This culture is a mixture if mostly white, young, hipsters. HR even made a few comments how we are a company of mostly young people so that's why the benefits are so good. Being in my mid to late 20s I should NOT feel like an old soul here! Why not add some diversity into this mix? It would only benefit the company to have different people with different life experiences.",

They are very strict with you having to be on the phones 3+ hours and making a certain number of app\u2026\u00a0ointments and pitches. It's ridiculous. They have a program that monitors how long you have been on the phones so even if its noon and you think you've been on the phones awhile, it could only turn out to be 40 mins in reality. Sales is tough and it's not for everyone, I suggest if you're just looking for a job DO NOT work here. If you're looking for a serious career in sales then do it.

They told me a bunch of lies (probably because they have such a high hiring quota to meet with the number or people they fire each week). They falsely assured me that although you don't have sales experience, they will teach you everything you need to know and that the training class was for SIXTY days. Also they said no one ever gets fired unless they have a bad attitude.Bull crap! I had a rough few days and had really turned it around at the end, working very hard, in good spirits with my team and working long hours. On my last day there, I had 5 pitches and 4 appts. Unfortunately, I was never allowed to see if I could close my first deal because they were eager to fire me by that afternoon.Develop your employees. There should never be a reason to fear that you are losing your job everyday and that you are indispensable. I've never seen a job in which so many people are fired or quit in such a short period of time, even if it is sales.I agree with everyone about the territories; my team had bad territories while other teams who had California, NY succeeded well.

The \"pitching\" part is honestly pretty fun but getting there is hard and 90% of the job will always be making open cold-calls, which in my opinion is too monotonous for me. Promotions are given when you reach a certain amount of sales, however despite pay raises the actual job never really changes nor do you assume any more responsibility. You just receive a different title to put on your resume. Although, you can decide to go into management over time and manage a team or move into selling mid-market and national brands, but like I said it still all involves cold-calling for the majority of the job. This reason for me is a deal breaker because if I'm not planning to stay here forever (or work as a cold-calling salesman forever, which I'm not) the only thing I can really say I've gotten good at is cold-call sales which really isn't that valuable of a skill to me. However, If you do really like this type of sales than the opportunity to make a lot of money is great if you become really good, and by really good I mean within top 10% of your hire-class. The other 90% either quit or get fired within the 1st year so enter at your own risk. Starting salary is 36K. The average employee becomes available to earn commission on top of that after about 6 months.

        "cons": "I do not even know where to begin with the cons of this company. Firstly, \"Account Executive\"=Telemarketer. This job consists of cold calling small business owners who do not want speak with you at all, and trying to convince them to spend thousands of dollars on advertising that usually does not work for these businesses. That is the only responsibility you have. All you do is cold call businesses that have bad stig\u2026\u00a0mas of Yelp already. What makes matters worse is that these business owners have already been rejected the many Yelp sales reps before you (which most probably quit), making these business owners even more upset. The lack of honesty in this company is outstanding as well. You are told that territories \"do not matter\" and to\" trust the process,\" when in fact whatever territory you are assigned absolutely determines your success as an \"Account Executive.\" The quota for a rep whose territory was in NYC is the exact same quota for a rap who calls into a small town in Pennsylvania with a population of 5,000 people. CRAZY. What makes matters worse is that I did not feel ethically selling a product to someone who I knew it would not work for. But no one at Yelp cares about this, it is all about revenue. The amount of people canceling advertiser service is laughable, and this company will soon breakdown in itself. Beware young, naive college grads: these people will lie to you about growing a long term \"career\" here but the chances of you being fired in your first 2 months for not hitting unattainable quotas is extremely high. This company is like a revolving door, people coming in and leaving just as quickly as they showed up. I would also like to add that if you are not a frat boy you will be looked over. \"drink the kool aid\" and maybe, just maybe you won't be fired. Would also like to add that managers are constantly talking behind you back (very obviously) and you are monitored in everything that you do, like a young child. Managers are chosen by popularity, so you are highly likely to be managed by someone who i completely unqualified. Also, 36K in NYC? That is insulting. These people are like a sweat shop. They prey on recent grads who live at home who do not know any better and work them to misery, and then just fire them. I really hope that this review prevents someone from making a mistake and accepting an offer here",

Hope you like reading from a sales s\u2026\u00a0cript, too, because that is all you will ever do at Yelp. Full sales cycles? - not happening! You have to turn over every account to Account Managers or Elite AEs. The managers here are all young and inexperienced; micromanagement is the name of their game. Nothing but 20-somethings at this office, which makes sense as the younger you are the more likely you are to buy in and drink the Kool-Aid. They hire a ton of kids right out of college that don't know how good they could have it at another more professional company. Very stressful job - which is not how professional sales should be. Again this is a straight up boiler room / telemarketing operation. 80 dials and 2 1/2 hours of talk time every day, and they record every call you make. Micromanagement to the extreme! Not a good place to work for an experienced sales professional; avoid wasting your time at Yelp.

Well trust me when I say each sales rep is paying portions of\u2026\u00a0 the overhead. If you understand the pay structure above then you get it. People get blinded my the music, games and free stuff because they don't get it right away. I would rather make the money than the free lunches.3. Territory, you better be good or be liked. That's how they base a lot of decisions.4.Micro Manage- they watch every detail of your day. 80 calls, talk time etc. But they say they don't micro manage....5. Majority of management was born and bred here. They have no other outside experience everyone speaks Yelp language and are very limited in there own experience. Which I believe limits every reps potential.6. As far as the \"executive team/directors\" I feel like someone gave them keys to the car but they don't have a license. It's really embarrassing to watch. They're clueless.7. If you leave....they take it personally and have verbally attacked and insulted people. I'm surprised I haven't heard lawsuits on this. HR must hate their life.8. Promotion & advancement? Yep they're growing but if you are amazing and crush it in sales that doesn't mean you will get it. Again, they pick who they want. I've seen many people be promoted and weren't qualified.9. They try to pump you up with internal testimonials (previous reps now managers) from earlier years, Yelp didn't have the reputation years ago they have today.

BUT......The pay is horrendous & the actual work is awful!!It was a shame I had to leave but I resigned before I had another opportunity lined up because the job was so awful.First I'll speak about the pay, there \u2026\u00a0isn't much to say except $35,000 a year is not enough live on in NYC. The offices are downtown - do they expect all of their employees to have less than an hour commute and live in the suburbs? I stay in the 'burbs, and let me tell you, after paying rent I had very little extra funds. They tell you that your first year you are expected to make 45-50k and that is just NOT the case and I will tell you why in a minute, but let me move on to why the job is awful.....It is simply cold calling sales. Meaning..... YOU'RE A GLORIFIED TELEMARKETER!!! You make 90-100 dials a day and you are supposed to be speaking with small business owners but very rarely do you get in touch with them. The metrics are 2+ hours of talk time, 65-80 dials a day and 3+ appointments. Those metrics are impossible to meet because literally no one wants to talk to you. So you keep getting hung up on by hostesses, peons, auto shop workers, ESL workers, nail salon women, and maybe some business owners (in the unlikely event that you get one on the phone).Therefore the only metric you are able to somewhat hit is the dials. If you don't schedule any appointments to show business owners the product then you obviously will not close a deal so, you won't make commission. To make commission you have to make $30,000+ for the company every month. The whole process is completely unrealistic and I feel as if you are set up for failure as an AE.There also isn't a lot of career opportunity or choices. Neither you're in inside sales or you're a manager - that's it.LISTEN TO ME: Cold-calling is not for everyone. 95% of the people you call DO NOT respect you and most of the time, they won't even view you as a human being. You're just another telemarketer trying to sell them something they have no interest in buying. So be ready for that.Oh and they shove how GREAT Yelp ads down your throat from the moment you walk in the door until the day you can't take it anymore and leave. I'll never forget my first day on the job, in training, when we were told getting this job at Yelp was harder than getting into Harvard University. No, they really said that. And it was only the beginning. You're constantly told that no other job in the world is fun and relaxed like your role at Yelp. They tell you Yelp is the greatest thing since sliced bread, even though public perception of the company continues to worsen, and look at you like you're crazy if you ever doubt the company and its capabilities. They TRY to brainwash you to believe that there is truly no other form of marketing that local businesses should ever consider. IT'S ALL A LIE!!!Also, on the sales floor we were constantly taught that over-talking and overselling the product demonstrated doubt in the product on our end as sales people. The thought process was the product is so great that all we had to do was present it, keep it simple and we were golden. Perhaps the management at Yelp should take this into account when they're telling us several times a month how lucky we are to have this job, how great it is, etc. You begin to realize that you, along with the rest of the sales floor, is sold by upper management on a daily basis. Things are carefully crafted and worded to put them in a more positive light to keep morale up, hints of promotions are thrown around liberally to inspire motivation and they always have an explanation/spin to negative press about the company, even if it's true. (Especially on the financial front)Please, for the love of God, stop calling yourself a startup, Yelp. The company is way, way past that phase and is anything but at this point. It's a large public company and the employees do not have the freedoms/opportunities they would at a traditional, true startup. This goes back to the ping pong tables, kegs, casual dress etc. In reality, they're hardly, if ever used. The keg is strictly off limits until after 5:30, no one uses the ping pong table unless they're staying inside the office for lunch (which I would recommend always getting outside and getting fresh air, unless it's freezing of course) or staying late after work. They're nothing more than props to A) entice desperate college graduates on the job hunt and B) give a false sense of working at a fun, laid-back startup to current employees.Make no mistake, the sales floor is high pressure and metrics are painstakingly monitored. And depending on your manager, it can be even more stressful. Certain managers even make their reps work through lunch, which is illegal, but I guess that doesn't really matter to the company when its struggling to hit its revenue numbers like never before. I can't say it enough, Yelp is NOT a startup anymore.Immature atmosphere. I think a lot of this goes back to the startup vibe. Most of the people on the sales floor have no idea what working at a startup is truly like, INCLUDING young supervisors who are still in their frickin 20s, but they think they have this shiny, unique job at a \"tech company\" and it almost makes them overcompensate. We share a building with Credit Suisse and I kid you not, I would hear Yelp reps crack jokes daily about the Credit Suisse employees after they got off the elevator about their professional attire, their jobs, etc. Yes, let's make fun of the people making three times as much as we are. That makes a lot of sense.Also, the office can be extremely high school-like. Very gossipy, cliquey. All of that nonsense. Overall just lacking professionalism in that department far too often.Territories. You're a slave to the system of territories. You will constantly be told that territories don't matter. Laugh every time you're told that. Territories absolutely matter. All of the best reps in the company have major metro areas like NYC, Boston, Chicago etc. If territories didn't matter, there wouldn't be certain managers who do shady things to get their reps the best territories possible. On top of that, because the company is under so much pressure to hit that magical billion in revenue, they are constantly hiring in large numbers. We're talking 70-80 people a class. Because of this, territories are getting smaller and accounts are being touched way too often. If you get a new territory, chances are the best accounts in it were touched no longer than 2 or 3 weeks ago.Oh, and everyone's screwing everyone!!! Managers screwing managers. Reps screwing reps. Reps screwing managers. It's like one big orgy at this place. Then again when everyone is in their 20s and full of raging hormones, what do u expect??It's VERY hard to sell against this company's reputation right now. The higher ups will tell you they've always had their share of obstacles, but reps who have been around since 2012 and 2013 will tell you it's noticeably more difficult than it's ever been right now. There's just too much anti-Yelp clout out there to make it all go away like they're aiming for. Most reps, like myself included, feel that if we don't close a business on the first call, we'll never close them. The reason being that they'll most likely go to Google when they're making their decision, and what they're going to see is nothing but negative. On top of that, the company as a whole is on the way down. It's not the \"next big thing\" or hot platform it was a few years ago. The stock is suffering and not going anywhere anytime soon.Conclusion: DO. NOT. WORK. HERE!!!!",

Most people work illegal overtime because their managers say that the best way to be successful is to never leave the office.

The other Yelp offices in NY, San Fran, Phoenix all are at about 3.5 star satisfaction rate. And Chicago? As of right now, 2.7 for satisfaction. What I also find ironic is that we're also the only office that has consistently missed quota months at a time while the other Yelp branches continue to see success. Perhaps the fact we're constantly (secretly, of course. you are looked down upon by management if you publicly express any feeling other than relentless happiness) miserable and overworked and overstressed due to poor management and poor developmental feedback. I feel like I've regressed since I rolled out of training because its difficult for me to keep my day in order because we're assigned specific tasks that we must do every day extra things to do ON TOP of making over 80-100 dials, talking for over 2.5 hours, setting 3 appointments, and pitching at least once a day. I feel like I'm set up for failure because my manager doesn't find it \"conducive\" to spend much time working with me since I'm \"not one of the top revenue producers\" on the team...why should that make a differentI'm tired from working so hard with no reason in return.
