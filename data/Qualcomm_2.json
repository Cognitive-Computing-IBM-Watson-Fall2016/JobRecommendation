Some divisions (QCT) within Qualcomm have NEVER had a workforce reduction/layoff. Others (QIS) have them regularly, and they happen just under the number required by federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act Guide to Advance Notice of Closings and Layoffs (i.e. you won't hear about the layoff in the news, but they do happen). Divisional leadership is clearly the reason.Senior Management Feedback:- not very approachable despite offer of having a 'door always open'- large delays in communicating important changes like reorganization to the team. It is highly likely that others outside the group will know before you do- some are vindictive; stay on their good side and you will be ok. cross or upset them then your career will be an endless uphill climb- some Directors spend an unusually large amount of time out of the office, coming in late and leaving early and ironically make comments on how it's unacceptable for engineers to come in late or leave early- decision-making by upper management has been dicey. employees pay for those bad decisions with tight deadlines and risky schedules- used current economic situation to inappropriately motivate/threaten employees to stay late and work harder- layoffs have led to very overloaded and stressed out team members. lots of work to do with less people, with no help in sight aside from temporary contractors",

Qualcomm credits itself for being like a giant startup, able to nimbly adapt to customer roadmap changes, and this is good, but it makes for an environment that is extremely difficult to penetrate if you were not born at the company.Qualcomm is like a jungl\u2026\u00a0e, and your ability to wield a machete should be at the top of your tool kit. It is a cut throat, back stabbing place where everyone is trying to get credit for things they may or may not actually be responsible for achieving in order to get promoted to the next level. There is very little respect for employees as they are viewed as work horses that need to be and often are, publicly whipped in order to get the last ounce of productivity out of. Qualcomm simply does not care about your work-life balance in spite of the presence of the basketball courts and cafeteria, both designed to keep you on site as long as possible.One of the biggest surprises to me, is how atypical the program management role is when compared to the rest of the industry. Program management in Qualcomm is not a position of authority. This job is in the process of changing from a role of assistant to engineering, ie. setting meetings, taking notes, arranging food for lunch, but always remember that it is engineering that calls the shots in this company and that's the way it will probably always be. Senior (director & VP level) program management leadership is nothing short of weak and something of a joke to the other VPs, easily swatted aside, opinions not considered, and in their frustration, often turn around and pass the same treatment along to their reports.In closing, if you are thinking of joining us as a program manager, think again - don't bother, find somewhere else to work, that's what I'm in the process of doing.",

Qualcomm has been able to do this because it is very very rich, so can easily afford to promote itself. The benefit to employees is that they are able t\u2026\u00a0o share some of this limelight, just by working for the company.

Highly reactive, which often results in less than optimal IT solutions. Engineers then look down upon IT for providing half-baked solutions, even when we were totally left out of any up-front planning and they need something \"yesterday\".Corporate IT is also highly siloed, and people get put in a box and rarely let out. If you are an Exchange administrator, then you have zero insight into storage, virtualization, networking, etc. Or maybe all you do is administer load balancers. Very little cross-discipline training or exposure. This stunts IT skills and IT careers. Everyone has their rice bowls, and getting major tasks accomplished that cross multiple groups is very painful. The helpdesk tries their best, but lacks good training and skilled staff. Extremely high turnover, and not very happy customers.Because the perks and company are good overall, the poor IT performers stay and rarely seem to leave. Getting HR to fire someone is nearly impossible and takes 6-9 months if not more, even if the person clearly is not even remotely performing at their level.

People are forced to come in when they are sick, work on weekends and nights, and work during vacation. Not to mention that compensation is not adjusted to market rates for employees who have been in the company for over 4 years.
