        "cons": "For a small company, it's highly political. It contradicts itself on several levels:1. By claiming to hire the best, but it hires incompetent leaders (especially middle management) and keeps legacy poor performers who are in the wrong roles (a.k.a., the Peter Principle).2. There is further hypocracy by not abiding by its values. It has become too layered with management that is inaccessible and won't shar\u2026\u00a0e information.3. It claims to be a global company, yet it mandates that in order to have any career path, you must be at the HQ in Mountain View. Exceptions are made to certain telecommuters on a hush-hush basis--but not to others--therefore creating unfair practices. As an internet company in this century, I would expect more flexibility in order to retain and attract employees.4. Benefits are marginal at best for an internet company trying to compete against the big boys. You may as well work at a bank.5. Wants to be a big player and has the attitude of its neighbor, but it is not implementing practices to compete.6.

They are so busy standing up in meetings to tell the managers how much they love working there, that any constructive criticism is seen as heresy, unappreciated and not reviewed seriously. The staff is not nice in general selfish environment that has snowballed to be that way by the snarky managers.There's a handful of senior level \u2026\u00a0team members that think it's funny to 'haze' new hires by not acknowledging their existence for their first 2 months. They tweet cruel comments about the other staff members. They also tell other team members when individuals are put on performance improvement plans. So these bad apples ruin it for the rest of the team. Many other team members simply aren't interested in getting to know you or anyone else new or not because it doesn't serve their bottom line. For a sales team, it's funny there's no camaraderie or even general warmth. When you have a company that preaches culture, but management participates in no actual way to improve it and the foot soldiers are destroying it, the decay of morale begins.Little to no training; it's sink or swim and they like it that way. So longer term employees have to pitch in and take time out to aid the same questions over and over because newbies get no overviews. In reality, it does not set one up as a new hire nor as a senior member as it's time consuming. It creates a hostile workplace where it's a weakness to ask questions and seek advice on improvement and there's nothing in it for senior team members as its not their job.

I was supposed to graduate in summer of 2013 and start work shortly thereafter. However, I've been a long time sufferer of depression, anxiety, and insomnia. I missed my summer graduation date and instead graduated in December of that year, due to my health issues. I informed my former boss ab\u2026\u00a0out my health issues, at which point he reduced my illness to being \"sad\" (demonstrating a complete lack of understanding of depression) and then proceeded to tell me that my full-time offer was rescinded.This company encourages a lot of physical health, and will even have pee color charts hanging in the bathrooms to tell you what healthy pee should look like, but does ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to help with mental health (unlike Google, which has programs specifically for mental health, because unlike LinkedIn, they actually understand the importance of mental health). I still have friends that work at LinkedIn, and they inform me that they are STILL doing nothing to this very day to assist with mental health.This is a company that will pepper you with gifts, treat you like a king, and make you feel like a part of the family, until you share that you have mental illness.

This may be because middle management is very inexperienced, from what I could see most are promoted into role and still trying to learn how to be managers and preferences to support their \"friends\" then make hard business choices.Linkedin is by far the most political environment that I've ever witnessed, manager is always involved in internal fights, instead of working towards one goal they fight for political power. Everyone smiles and says they are your friends by they are looking out for themselves. Making many of the sales people very unhappy but afraid to voice concerns in fear of their jobs.Compared to hiring standards and creative thinking in other online companies in Dublin, Linkedin is more close minded, managers are inexperienced and staff only looking to get a the brand name on their CV before moving on.

They want to position themselves as employers on a par with the likes of Google and Facebook, but they are significantly lacking programmes for staff development and training to make this the case.Training repeatedly promised during my time there, was never delivered. Procedures and the \u2018LinkedIn way\u2019 of doing things were co\u2026\u00a0nstantly alluded to but never clarified or laid out through training or mentorship. This was particularly evident with standards and targets, where concrete targets were NEVER clearly communicated. Requests for feedback go unanswered, quarterly reviews don\u2019t happen (!), and when this is questioned, vague, non-committal responses are provided\u2026 again, highlighting the inexperience of the management.Standard processes and procedures are non-existent in the LinkedIn Dublin office. Promotion ladders are quickly climbed for favoured staff members, where others are deliberately excluded from application. There was no evidence of a HR involvement with internal departmental management or promotion.It is clear that a policy of over-recruiting for certain teams exists as a means to hedge their bets in terms of handling market growth. Unfortunately, LinkedIn\u2019s lack of monitoring or projecting their growth and lack of understanding their customer requirements means that they have no way to predict the volumes they expect their staff to handle\u2026 over-staffing in these departments leads to a low case numbers and poaching between team mates in an attempt to reach unrealistic targets. These staff are kept in an extended probationary period as a way to dispose of them when it becomes necessary. Unfortunately for LinkedIn, Ireland is a small place and this practice of \u2018probationary recruitment\u2019 has been noticed by some of the main recruitment companies.The most frightening example of poor management staff handling I witnessed was during the visit of the CEO Jeff Weiner in Dublin, Irish employees were asked to be seated in the front row and meet him whereas the foreign employees from Brazil, Italy, Portugal, and France were asked to step back. There\u2019s a word for that\u2026discrimination.For a company providing recruitment products LinkedIn\u2019s own recruitment procedures are alarming and considerably off base from their supposed ideals. Calls from initial recruiter outside available contact hours, repeated rescheduling interviews and meetings as managers were \u2018travelling\u2019 or \u2018sick\u2019 meant that a recruitment period of 6 weeks required 5 interviews, each with different members of staff and HR representatives, and a language test.Even after head-hunting and recruiting from other well-known Dublin based companies like Google, PayPal and Facebook, the obvious ineptitude of management levels in LinkedIn Dublin means that many of these staff left within a short period to return to their previous employers.It is clear that LinkedIn (Dublin) is still in shaky start-up territory. A massive recruitment push to prove to the American offices that Dublin is effective venture has led to selection of poor, inexperienced managers who, without guidelines to follow or a clear idea of how they want to expand the company (or maybe they do know, but they never communicate them to staff) are flying blind and believing their own hype.",
