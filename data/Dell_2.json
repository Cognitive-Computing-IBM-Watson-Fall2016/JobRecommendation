Many people suffer from extreme stress and related health problems due to the high demands of the job. It's not unusual to work 60+ hours a week on a regular basis.

What is the point of being an $8\u2026\u00a00 billion dollar company? I mean, isn't it more important to focus on the quality of the products you're producing and the way you treat the people who work for you and buy from you? I've seen many examples of companies who spent their energy on improving their products, their work environment, and their customer relations and the profits followed naturally. I would suggest the management at Dell consider this type of strategy if they truly want to be successful.",
