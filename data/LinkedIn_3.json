        "cons": "Poor advancement opportunities. I went to LinkedIn specifically to advance my career, making it very clear when I got hired that my biggest fear was doing the same thing I had previously done. LinkedIn poached me, so I thought the hiring manager would have realized they couldn't expect me to do the same thing for a year.Unfortunately, this is exactly what happened, so I left a year later. Ad Operations is not\u2026\u00a0orious for this in the industry, but it is especially true at LinkedIn. It seems exciting because LinkedIn is an awesome company with very smart people, but it has also grown far too quickly to give real career opportunities to the majority of employees. Many in my department either leave the department or company in order to find their next step. Senior titles aren't really different. They need to seriously reevaluate their advancement structure.The middle managers also aren't great. They don't have enough experience to really help support the ICs and are also very lacking in their ability to have career conversations or provide training. Leadership also had a lack of professionalism that I don't think is right to talk about here, but made me lose a lot of respect for the company.Big picture - The company is a great, exciting company to work for. I would recommend working here, but not as a Campaign Manager to anyone that has experience in it. Great for a first job, not so great for a second or third.",

Lots of Operators focused on doing things fast and furious even it means scratching and redoing the same over and over again, but very little strategists -except at the very top- with big picture and collateral damage effect skills willing to do the right things right first time.Paradox of 70% of Individuals having a year or less in the company, among them lots of millennial, meaning talented but young with limited experience and expertise, when 80% of directors and up have been promoted from within over the years so lack of diversity of thoughts, making it quite hard to enter their circle, get alignment on new and/or different ways and often facing a very polite and very politically correct but \"been there done that mentality\".",

        "cons": "Within the org that I was in (GSO - Global Sales Org), salary for technical individuals are capped at below market, so eventually most technical people go to other companies after a few years. The senior management has a very \"old corp\" culture when it comes to promotions (\"pay your dues\", \"let's not set a precedent\", \"we'll talk in a year\") that is based on age and tenure rather than skill. The management structure \u2026\u00a0also favors MBAs managing technical teams, so the technical ICs have to teach their managers, while not getting meaningful feedback and support. This I believe was unique to the GSO and not a problem for other parts of LinkedIn.Career path was another problem. There's a very low ceiling within the GSO for an IC. You'd hit that ceiling very quickly and will have to make the decision to either be a manager, or be an IC with a capped comp even though you are providing more value year over year. Within the GSO, management is the holy grail (a bit like old corp) for many people, and because managers don't do IC work, some ICs try to learn how to be managers by getting other people to do their work. It's a talker's culture within the GSO, not a doer's culture. There are more meetings than war room sessions. People sit down and talk about execution, talk to stake holders, looping in everyone but their grandmas, and then get the poor IC who is the lowest paid person at the table to slug it out. Management often take credit for that work by representing it to senior leaders without crediting back to the IC.Morale was a problem on our client facing team because their managers are very much \"yes men\" serving the sales teams, that means the client facing team has to work all hours, have surprise quick turn around projects, and are faced with management practices that are contrary to LinkedIn's core values (such as a manager saying \"I'd be careful about your professional image\" when a teammate voiced concerns about being verbally abused during a meeting).The senior leadership also has an ineffective way of dealing with talent competition. The comp package seems to be tightly regulated and capped below market, it is fairly easy for competitors to swoop in with what seems to the candidate as amazing offers. The management's response to this has been to create uncertainty with the new position, and attempt to offer delayed rewards (we'll promote you in a year) - basically anything that doesn't involve in materially making good on a better offer. The person leaving will be subjected to repeated meetings with their manager and their superiors to question the candidate's intent, whether if they were team players, and whether they'd want to let their team down. All in all, not a great way to try to win someone back, and makes them more determined to leave.",
        "advice": "LinkedIn has a vision for employer - employee partnership. Reid Hoffman's vision is extraordinary so please let's all live up to it! GSO is a business facing org, but that doesn't mean Reid's visions no longer holds true. If team members are not treated equitably, offered market rates, supported with learning opportunities and career trajectories that are more than pats on the back, then we'll get closer to it. And y\u2026\u00a0es, the grass is indeed greener on the other side.",
        "pros": "Great work life balance (at least for the projects and tools team, for the client facing team, it's bone crushing hours). The location of the office is very convenient.

For example as a sales rep they say you're evaluated on \"leadership, leverage, results\". That is a lie. When it comes to th\u2026\u00a0e evaluations they only look at results.Horrible sales territory. Linkedin is good at over hiring for specific countries because they know that certain individual sales reps will never make their quota.Ridiculous sales targets. As inside sales you have to bring in way over half a million dollar.The relationship with the field sales reps is close to hatred. Field reps stealing your accounts is a normal thing. And the worst part is that your managers in Dublin don't do anything about it.The field sales reps are generally of a lower quality than the inside sales people because Linkedin does not have a strong employer brand in most European countries outside of the UK.And in general senior leadership in Dublin is of a very poor quality.",

Getting talents is easy for LinkedIn, If you are seeing a job being posted for a while and not filled, it only\u2026\u00a0 indicates the position is not urgent, recruiter doing pipeline or hiring manager is fussy.LinkedIn treats sales well with benefits but the growth opportunities are limited. During interviews you will be told stories like internal promotion or so-called \"transformation\", probably also \"young, energetic employees's fast growth\". Such chances happening lesser and lesser, although the company is growing quickly, most hiring managers prefer to give opportunity to candidates with more years of work experience or MBAs, rather than providing chance to internals who want to learn and grow. I did not see many promotions and transformations happened - comparing with a few years ago the company is no longer flexible in terms of giving internals opportunities.If you are about to get an offer from LinkedIn as sales, ask recruiter the following questions:- what is my level? (In certain regions, they lower your rank and even you are experienced sales, you may find your level is the same as junior sales in US who only has 3-4 years of working experience) - this impacts your internal opportunity and future growth path.- what is the expected growth for my territory? Besides the effort I am putting to grow revenue, what are the supports coming from LinkedIn to help the territory grow in order to achieve the desired result?- Is my quota or account growth ratio reasonably linked with the market situation?- how many people in my team are making number?- in the past 6-12 months, how many people in this team had been promoted or having a career transformation?",

Please be \"people manager\" and start to spend sometime with the individuals in the front line team.LinkedIn is lacking of appreciation, and employees don't really get a sincere \"thank you\" from the senior management.In the recent 12 months, I witnessed more cases that hiring managers do not pay respect to both internal and external candidates.",
