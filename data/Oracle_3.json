The company is so large that th\u2026\u00a0ey basically consider it 'losing you' instead of thinking of what is best for the entire company.\u00a0It would be easier to get hired by a competitor than to move from Apps to Tech, from Commercial Accounts to Strategic, etc. Obviously the rare exception is that you are personal friends with your manager and they are willing to sacrafice for your own happiness...but the most likely scenario is that you see a position you would be interested in, then to make the transfer you have to notify your boss.
