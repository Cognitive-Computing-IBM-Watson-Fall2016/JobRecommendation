The guy who has the highest sales could technically earn as much as the guy with the least amount of sales.To get a promotion is difficult because there are many people vying for one spot.Different roles in the store are very stressful. Sometimes we have to help multiple customers at once with very diverse problems. We have to turn people away from tech support because they don't have an appointment to meet with a technician. It gets very difficult after the 20th time in an hour.Your hours will vary because of the stores longs hours. Sometimes you work early in the morning and sometimes late at night.

I thought A\u2026\u00a0pple corporate diversity would resemble the retail store diversity. I could tell the interns of color noticed it too. I was talking to one of them and the intern mentioned visiting Google campus and that it was way more diverse. I recently visited Google at lunch for an interview and my friend was right, it\u2019s a totally different feeling. Google\u2019s executive leadership on the website even shows a person of color and a woman. I love Apple but sometimes wondered if it was by design (like their products).

During the holidays, 30-50% of the employees in th\u2026\u00a0e store will be at some degree of ill, many repeatedly re-catching illness from other co-workers.Upwards mobility is limited. Apple often hires outside manager candidates with little or no experience working in the store and places them in a position to manage people far more experience than them. Apple also has policies in place to prevent managers from building a human connection with the people they manage, such as preventing the few internally hired managers from working with previous co-workers, and preventing managers from having any social interaction with non-management employees outside the store. As a result, managers form their own \"social click\" like the the \"cool kids in high school\" that is entirely detached from the rest of the store.",
