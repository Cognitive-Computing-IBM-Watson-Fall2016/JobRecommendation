Many have no credible management training and no \u2026\u00a0degree above high school. They were simply just there long enough and eventually pushed into management. To these people, nothing else matters. This group is essentially closed off to outsiders, so forget about being in it. They also enjoy flaunting their money to everyone (BMW cars, $10k watches, Tesla cars etc...) thus lowering the moral of their staff even further.Qualcomm boasts the phrase \"work life balance\", however to management, work is their life so the phrase is all but irrelevant to them, which in turn filters down to the employees. So employees get worked to the bone.Promotions, performance and appreciation (and remaining employed) are honored on a strict \"who you know/blow\" basis. Hence, if you grease the right wheel or know the right people you can get 3 promotions in 3 years, even if you do nothing.

        "cons": "Some serious non-sense meetings. I don\u2019t think I have seen as much time wasting and mud slinging meeting as the ones that Qualcomm have. Decisions need to be \u201csocialized\u201d in a \u201cdemocratic fashion.\u201d I can feel my stomach tighten at these buzzwords. The managers were not big on taking responsibility, so it\u2019s my responsibility to convince all participants. Sounds great in theory, but in practice, this just means you got\u2026\u00a0 to do the hard work to convince more people, or one week later, you are sitting through another meeting talking about the same thing. I rarely see meetings produce to-do list and action items. Most meeting last 30 mins or an hour, even though they really could be shortened. I\u2019ve seen level 3 engineers\u2019 days being fully booked with meetings, and sometimes double booked, so they better do work during nights and weekends. But really, the worst part of meetings is mud slinging shouting matches that occur when some features break. One time we had frequent crash in a handset; it was traced to a watchdog condition. One of the conditions that might trigger it was a full heap. So we reasonably asked if the responsible parties could check memory leaks. I could swear someone was getting bloody murdered by the loud shouting and responsibility deflecting. Waste of time all around.Stodgy, antiquated, monotonous software strategy! I worked in QIS (Qualcomm Internet Services), a purportedly web services division of the company. But there was much attitude against integrating emerging practices and technology. We even had a meeting back in 2013 from legal telling us not to participate in open source forums (not code contribution, but just Q/A forums), not to sign an 3rd party agreements (which effectively means not to download Android SDK, iOS SDK) without informing the legal department first. Of course, the bigger disappointment is that even when I was leaving, I hardly saw modern practices like continuous delivery, continuous integration, DevOps, continuous testing, etc, etc. Each handset software release takes weeks in straight waterfall (dev -> test -> integration -> release). Even with a lengthy schedule, software often ship with major undiscovered bugs. I used to snigger at the term \u201cfeature complete release;\u201d because it might as well mean crash after 5 minutes. I feel senior employees at Qualcomm San Diego can really benefit a lot by taking an externship at lean startups and actually learn something about efficiency and process automation.Duplication of efforts. Where do I begin on this one\u2026 There are often multiple internally developed or internally available tools for you to do the same thing, but good luck to you if you need help setting it up. To give you an example, I needed to do some integration testing with some QC partner corporations. One of the tasks is automated dialing and torture testing. Supposedly there were 3 tools available for me to use. One was developed by a separate QC division; and it was obviously meant to do some serious heavy lifting. I couldn\u2019t use it because our liaison couldn\u2019t get the help, and the customization effort to get it to use look into LTE protocol instead of CDMA was high. Another tool was developed by an outside consulting firm; we couldn\u2019t use it because it didn\u2019t have the right driver. Yet another internally developed tool was not used for a reason or another I couldn\u2019t remember. So I had to write a script to do automated dialing. Just to think, 3 separate groups got credit for developing their tools (and got credit), then moved on, and never thought about supporting them again. Apparently my experience was not unique.Slow pace of advancement. As a lot of people have mentioned before, doing hard work for long period of time often don\u2019t get you the advancement. Fixing software bugs and pushing out new releases from 9AM to 9PM day after day will maybe get you to the next level after 5 years. Majority of Qualcomm departments are not growing, so your advancement opportunity is limited. Much of the employees at Qualcomm are pretty young, so advancement through attrition is really not an option. When I was quitting, I was offered advancement to stay. This really doesn\u2019t inspire loyalty.",
        "advice": "Actually instead of advice to management, I will give advice to would-be employees:At Qualcomm, there's an endless amount of work to do. If you are a hard charger, you can fill out a 60-80 work hour week really quickly. At Lunch, you eat at the Qualcomm caf\u00e9; you go to the Qualcomm gym; swim at the large pool at the Jacobs Community Center; if get sick, use the Qualcomm Health Center; every few months, you will s\u2026\u00a0ee your bosses 4 levels above ride off into retirement in their Tesla/BMW/Lexus. It will be easy to lose yourself in this big Qualcomm \"life\" and think the big QC will take care of you from cradle to the grave. BUT IT'S NOT!It's a slow slog fighting for advancement. Doing the normal work (fixing software bugs, churning out another modem software releases, do another release build) will elevate you very slowly. For a tech company, there really seem to be sense that only your seniority matters in terms of advancement. That, and of course your mastery of manipulating your own political perception.Qualcomm is a business, just like anything else, which means profits above most things. While I get to hear some lovely mantras like \u201cwork-life balance\u201d and \u201copen door policy\u201d; it\u2019s almost not used at a practical level. Read all the comments about work life balance, and see if anyone thinks you can balance your life and work in QC. The \u201copen door policy\u201d means you should be able to bring any concerns and issues to managers. The only time I hear people air out dirty laundry is when they are transferring or they are leaving. So go figure.Don\u2019t lose yourself in Qualcomm life, it\u2019s incredibly easy to lose your sense of the outside world in the daily grind. Keep an ear to the outside world, and see what\u2019s interesting. Qualcomm has successfully milked 3G and 4G and related services. But the competitive landscape is also sifting; you have to decide where the puck is going to be, and be there.",
