As a post-adolescent company, Microsoft increasingly values work/life balance. You are expected to work hard but don't need to kill yourself unless you really want to. The other thing that I think is cool about Microsoft is that the company generally doesn't give up. 15 years ago, Microsoft was a PC software company. Then management decided that Microsoft needed to be an enterprise software company too. Nobody gave Microsoft much of chance to be a serious enterprise software company. Today, most big companies use Microsoft software. Similarly, today most don't give Microsoft much of chance of being a successful \"internet\" company (vague definition, I know).

This can lead to perverse situations where people who are good at managing up do better than those who are not, regardless of their skill (I've seen this at companies of 20 people too, so don't expect any different here).Things can move slowly.

Despite a huge amount of construction, there continues to be a significant shortage of office space in the Redmond and Seattle area.

Some times groups are not as coordinated as they should be and sometimes decisions take too\u2026\u00a0 long to get. However, if you make a good case, you can get major projects funded and resources assigned to try to make them realities.",

Microsoft remains Redmo\u2026\u00a0nd focused, but is getting much better at this issue. There is much more openness to people (including software developers) being located places other than Redmond.

Sounds good until you need to do any of the multitude \u2026\u00a0of things that a global enterprise needs to run smoothly. Or, god forbid, stick to a budget. Growing pains have taken their toll on morale as the same \"new\" ideas and projects are generated over and over, soak up millions, languish and die. As a result, the \"message\" to employees is confused and inconsistent. Salaries are below industry average (no matter what they tell you), the expectations are high, and the newly minted red tape is incredibly annoying.

If this happens be diplomatic about it, give feedback to your leads and senior managers and remember that sometimes they are still learn\u2026\u00a0ing too. Also, as a downside to having high career growth you can be put in a situation where they will give you more responsibility than you asked for.

The people you \u2026\u00a0meet in the hallway usually seem happy to be there (minus the guys that are late to their meetings and coding on their laptops while trying to hit the right elevator buttons) and you can almost always strike up a good conversation with someone interesting at lunch (we're not all antisocial nerds, well at least not all the time =P)If you are a fresher like myself, I have found the environment to be very nurturing yet at the same time there is plenty of challenge so you will feel proud of your work when you are done. At my previous company when management said I did a good job on a project I just shrugged it off, but when someone says you're doing a good job at Microsoft it is really something to be proud of!!\u201d",
