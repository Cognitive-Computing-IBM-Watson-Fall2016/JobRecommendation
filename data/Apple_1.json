        "cons": "The management is completely horrible! Like I said before, the managers used to be good, but now Apple is hiring anyone and everyone with retail experience, which completely goes against Apple's plan for their retail stores. Ron Johnson, head of Apple retail, originally designed the stores after luxury hotel chains in order to give quality service to its employees, but unfortunately, things have changed drastically. \u2026\u00a0I was even told by my manager that we had to start hiring people who used Dells and owned an iPod because \"we had exhausted all possible routes\" to find other Mac users who would be interested in working in the retail stores. This was completely bogus because I know tons of people who use Macs and don't work at Apple.The recent employees hired and the management are all wrong for Apple. My management even started distancing the true Mac users, like me, from working there. Despite my full time availability, I was only given about 10-16 hours per week right before I left. I was also told that other people would receive full time before me, even though I had been there longer than the other person being considered. Talk about no motivation.Everyone also felt extremely overworked and underpaid. The raises were completely arbitrary, and the new hires weren't trained to sell Macs, just iPods and iPhones, so there were still the same number of people to help people who wanted to buy Macs, which just weren't enough.Also, one of my managers had a problem with physicality. This manager touched people inappropriately, and even physicially threatened to harm another employee..and still works there!",
        "advice": "Listen to your employees; give them valuable feedback, and stop being rude to them. Mac Specialists are the ones bringing in the money for the store, so maybe you should treat them with respect.",
        "pros": "The best reason to work for Apple was definitely the discounts; in fact, I plan to go back to work there, in a lesser capacity, in order to receive the discounts again. Apple has the coolest technology out there, and as a fan of theirs for a long time, it was great to get first hand knowledge and experience on the latest products. Also, when I first started working for Apple in 2006, there were a tight-knit group of \u2026\u00a0employees who were \"Mac-heads,\" and it was a great environment to work in. As soon as Ron Johnson got word that customers weren't getting enough attention due to not enough employees, Apple started hiring everyone in sight, and the environment became what it is today.",

Tattoos, unnaturally colored hair, hippie clothes, and a penchant for reading comic books and playing Dungeons and Dragons puts you in contention for higher positions in the store over virtues like positive attitude, good conduct, hard w\u2026\u00a0ork, and reliability. There have been instances I've seen where people have been promoted because they had the right \"look\" rather than the right attitude for the job. It really makes you dissatisfied with your work experience when a company that will literally do anything for their customers do so little for their employees.",
        "advice": "I would love to give senior management feedback, but unfortunately they are absent. The regional and store managers for my location left their positions in November, and even now in June the positions aren't filled. There is currently one manager splitting time between two stores to compensate for having a store manager, which is not cutting it. This retail store is being run by four assistant managers who are frankl\u2026\u00a0y floundering without a management figure present in the store. There is also a terrible elitist attitude in the Apple retail stores, where customers are put off by the \"I work for Apple, therefore I'm better than you\" attitude. This attitude even comes forward when one worker is interacting with another, again producing a negative work experience. There are changes that need to be made to the retail stores that nobody has the guts to tell Steve Jobs about. But I guess that's what you get with a company that was founded by an anti-social person who consumed illegal drugs in the 1970s.",
        "pros": "Apple has a name brand recognition like no other in the retail market. When someone sees the company \"Apple\" on your resume you are automatically put to the top of their list because of their perceived prominence in the retail computer market.

All of these products have \u2026\u00a0a simplistic elegance and sophistication in their design, which is shared with the design of the Apple retail stores.

Have you ever seen Apple on the Forbes 100 Best Places to Work?' Enough said. You will be just a number to them if you decide to join their ranks. The focus is purely on product and the bottom line, which of course is no surprise in the corporate world. But if you're a corpor\u2026\u00a0ate hooch, I guess you won't mind that. 'Think Different!' Ahem. And here's some juicy gossip: Steve is afraid of donuts! How do I know? Because he banned them, along with balloons from Macs cafe. He also has a fear of buttons. Origin of this phobia - unknown. But here is what you should be afraid of my friends; the tendency that Apple and just about every company these days has to keep Permatemps. You may want to board the Mother Ship so badly it hurts, but take my advice and do it the regular way, through the Apple hiring process. Don't go through an 'agency.' Basically they are in the business of laundering...people. These are shady operations that are not even real companies and are in cahoots with Apple to deny you benefits or any basic rights, all while forcing you to do the same work and keep exactly the same hours as employees.

If WWDC is rescheduled at the last \u2026\u00a0minute, for example, hundreds of engineers will be asked to change their vacations, even if they've already made plans (and paid for tickets).At the end of a cycle, a $20 bottle of wine or a $50 iPod shuffle reflect the gratitude you'll receive, and the value of your work to your management. It is against Apple policy for your name to be recognized externally; only Steve Jobs' name, or the names of those he picks to introduce them, can be associated with a product release.At least one division was giving less than 3% in average yearly salary increases to critical senior engineers, while the company's profits soared. And if you're a manager, it's not discouraged for you to go several years without accepting a raise, just so you can use the budget savings for your staff's salaries.It's a well-known secret that the best way to get a large raise and promotion at Apple is to leave and be hired back a few years later into the new position.",
        "advice": "Hold an internal employee communications meeting that doesn't open with Steve Jobs thanking all the engineers' for all the time they've given up with their families. For three years, they all opened that way, and I am sure they still do.Give QA the resources to truly test products before their release. Snow Leopard is a nice step in that direction, but try it with Mac OS X Server, and Airport, and MobileMe. B\u2026\u00a0ack To My Mac was a fantastic Leopard feature, and it would be great if it had ever worked--maybe find that out before the product ships, and not afterwards?Once MobileMe is a success, don't forget it wasn't a boxed product. The web services Apple provides require daily maintenance, actual backups, and talented people with a long-term commitment to making them work. Don't starve their budgets until they go back to the terrible availability and service that .Mac was well known for.As Apple's developer and user base grow, and its products are accepted into more and more businesses, Apple needs a plan to manage the increased QA and sustaining engineering efforts.Continuing to let a project die of neglect for years while insisting it's got full support (Java, WebObjects, .Mac) will grow old, and the userbase will move on to the next big thing.There's no replacement for experienced engineers. Sure, overseas contractors are cheaper, and kids just out of college have great ideas and unlimited energy, but at the end of the day, someone has to know what they're doing. Cherish and retain your senior staff. Don't wave press releases gloating over the money the company has on hand in their faces, praise their hard work, and then deny them a raise that meets inflation.And just because someone isn't in Steve Jobs' direct line of sight, doesn't mean they're not important to the company.",
        "pros": "There are few better companies to have on your resum\u00e9.Apple is an innovative leader in the consumer products field, and recognized around the world as having some of the best engineering, marketing, and final products in the industry.Few engineers in Cupertino have to work on infrastructure, as most IT development work is outsourced to overseas contractors.While the cafeteria doesn't compare t\u2026\u00a0o Google's, it's not bad at all, and is improving lately.

If you enter as a developer, you will be involuntarily assigned to work as a technical program/project manager role where you will delegate all your code to onshore and offshore developers. Sometimes you'll get good developers, but most of the time, you'll get mediocre or below-average developers. There\u2026\u00a0 is no diversity in this department as the overall ethnicity is 99.999% India descent. Most of the senior managers are not technical, not hands-on and rely solely on the program/project managers/consultants to deliver all projects for them. The technical knowledge is heavily relied on the consultant/contractor engineers. The performance reviews can be conducted arbitrarily and can be tweaked at the discretion of the manager. It depends on the manager's integrity and honor if he/she will base your performance on merit. Over time, the more you do project management work, the less you will do technical work unless you put in long hours at night. The management team will do whatever possible to protect themselves and avoid all risk. There is a lot of politics and arrogance. One director hired most of her managers from her previous company. Everyone who knew the director ascended to management ranks by this association. So either it is by coincidence or maybe cronyism? If you don't belong in that \"3com club\", then you will not be as richly compensated. e.g. The managers brag to their employees about buying and/or rebuilding 1- 3 million dollar homes (ground up) in areas of Saratoga, Cupertino, and Evergreen.Just to emphasize, this is for the Apple IS&T department. All other product development teams - iCloud, iTunes, etc. will not have this environment. Furthermore, it can be confirmed that those departments are more diverse in ethnicities, rely on badged employees for development work, and work long hours depending on the team and project.",

They will not accommodate flexibility with work schedule and still expect 60 - 70 hours of extreme work pressure. They have no apathy and will fire you even if you go on medical leave. Not a place for those who have any empairments.",
