On a floor of 70+ sales people only two were African American until one was fired during training although he was selling well. Favoritism and being very flirty will get you a good territory. Unfortunately, the territories you get have all been worked to death and the business owners will be so annoyed they will literally threaten you.\u2026\u00a0 You will be harassing the same people over and over despite them not being able to buy due to economic reason- for example, a few businesses I was calling went out of business and I was still forced to call them up until they closed their doors and in the meantime I lost on other good leads- well actually, their inventory is no organized and they bought many fake listings that show up on your pipeline. You will literally call everyone who has ever has a yelp page and harass them until they buy. My territories were very strange- one was a total loss, a very very poor area (well known through out, actually a skid row) and the other was a bit better, and I made large sales there. It really doesn't take much talent as they would have you think to make sales- IF you get a healthy territory with inventory then you'll make sales easily. The problem is inventory is NOT always available and combined with a horrible territory and 60+ closed/fake businesses in your pipeline you are doomed. You will burn out quickly unless you are making target every month. Sounds like a great job and it can be, but it is in no way creative and you literally do the same thing every day. Every day.

The offices are downtown - do they expect all of their employees to have an hour commute and live in the suburbs. I stay downtown \u2026\u00a0but let me tell you after paying rent I had very little extra funds. They tell you that your first year you are expected to make 45-50k and that is just NOT the case and I will tell you why. Now, let me move on to why the job is awful.It is simply cold calling sales. You make 90-100 dials a day and you are supposed to be speaking with small business owners but very rarely do you get in touch with them. The metrics are 2 hours of talk time, 65+ dials a day and 3 appointments. Those metrics are impossible to meet because no one wants to talk to you, you keep getting hung up on by hostesses and business owners (in the unlikely event that you get one on the phone). Therefore the only metric you are able to easily hit is the dials. If you don't not schedule any appointments to show business owners the product then you obviously will not close a deal so, you won't make commission. To make commission you have to make $30,000+ for the company every month. The whole process is completely unrealistic and I feel as if you are set up for failure as an AE.\u2022There also isn't a lot of career opportunity or choices. Neither you're in inside sales or you're a manager - that's it.",

If they google \"Yelp Advertising\" and see blogs and documentaries that say bad things and then never answer the phone to me I can't really control that. I hope they become bigger and better but they can't keep ignoring what people and business owners are saying - especially when business growth depends on it! They need to start looking into other revenue streams.

I've been working here for over a year and was a serious believer in the job however in the last few months I can't stand it.I've had 4 team changes in the last year. That means working under FOUR different managers. A lot of managers, with exception of some senior level, are seriously so awful! Lack serious intelligence and care for their reps. Please d\u2026\u00a0o something about this! It's not all about \"trusting a process\"...sometimes there are actual issues that are out of the sales reps control like territory!As other have said, territory plays a huge role in success. I've called small towns in Canada for the last year and they have never heard of yelp. How can I meet a $20k monthly quota when I'm calling a place that knows nothing about the company and has no intrinsic need for the product? The value doesn't make sense. My advice? Start marketing and tapping into user base/business owners in Canadian/rural areas rather than having reps do the work of \"educating\". Seriously, seriously frustrating.Pay!!!! Pay more for base salary! $36k is a joke and half for start pay in San Francisco...enough said. Very telling to see upper management and execs gloss over the question of higher pay in all hands meetings. Turn over is awful and it effects the culture. Recognize it and do something rather than changing commission structure or skirting around the question when asked by your sales team.Upward mobility to other positions like management, SeatMe, and Mid market are all dependent on the rep and if you have a good manager. Success is very much put on the individual and \"trusting the process\". Sell a lot and doors will open, struggle to find your way without much guidance and your \"why\" for being there becomes less clear.Very, very draining day to day task. Some managers will question why you are taking time off which is very uncomfortable.They have a lot of resources to grow your abilities and improve language on the phone, however the overflow of information on what works and what doesn't is very overwhelming. It can feel like you are doing or saying something wrong at every possible moment when having a conversation with a business owner. It's hard to implement feedback sometimes when you have a paranoia and stress about how you should sound and what language you should say on the phone.Yelp also needs to listen to business owners and not just those who sing high praise about the advertising program. If yelp wants to continue to partner and sell to business owners, then tap into their needs and listen to their concerns rather than only selling a pipe dream in the form of yelp ads. It's so disheartening to receive emails, voicemails and phone calls from business owners about how much they hate yelp without being able to do anything for them. I feel for these people because the only time they get through to the company is when a rep calls them.Also, seriously restructure your account manager process and teams. They are the absolute worse and do nothing to support AEs and business owners.Fratty and unprofessional attitudes are real here. I have met some great people and I have also met some of the worst people ever. Choose your friends wisely and do not get romantically involved with anyone at the company if you can avoid it. The more you separate your life from work/colleague friends then the better. Less drama.",
        "advice": "Base pay needs to go up. Marketing the company into rural/Canadian markets. Realize when a territory isn't working for a rep and act quickly. Value current employees and do all that you can to improve their work happiness like with adequate pay and commission opportunities. Promote real leaders not sales people who just put up big numbers. Implement feedback from bottom employees. If the company is based on local bus\u2026\u00a0iness then be about that and for that. Do right by the business owner.",
        "pros": "Free food, upbeat environment, some good managers who really believe in you, very good training - you will know every thing about yelp and sales especially how to deal with very uncomfortable conversations.

Headquarter office is also a really beautiful building which \u2026\u00a0no longer houses the local sales teams.This job will prepare you for the worst of it all and you can keep reminding yourself that you will hopefully never make as little of money as you are right now in your life - do this if you're 22 not 42.",

        "cons": "First off, notice how I didn't really say anything about the actual job itself in the pros. That's because it sucks, but then again, it is what it is and in reality you know what you're signing up for when you take the position. Cold-calling is not for everyone. 90% of the people you call will never respect you and most of the time, they won't even view you as a human being. You're just another telemarketer trying to\u2026\u00a0 sell them something they have no interest in buying. So be ready for that feeling.- The infamous Yelp koolaid. Man, they shove it down your throat from the moment you walk in the door until the day you can't take it anymore and leave. I'll never forget my first day on the job, in training, when we were told getting this job at Yelp was harder than getting into Harvard University. No, they really said that. And it was only the beginning. You're constantly told that no other job in the world is fun and relaxed like your role at Yelp. They tell you Yelp is the greatest thing since sliced bread, even though public perception of the company continues to worsen, and look at you like you're crazy if you ever doubt the company and its capabilities. They brainwash you to believe that there is truly no other form of marketing that local businesses should ever consider. And hey, man, I get it - I'm sure sales roles everywhere are like this because you ultimately have to believe in the product, but Yelp goes way over the top here to the point where it turns a lot of employees, like myself, off.Also, on the sales floor we were constantly taught that over-talking and overselling the product demonstrated doubt in the product on our end as sales people. The thought process was the product is so great that all we had to do was present it, keep it simple and we were golden. Perhaps the management at Yelp should take this into account when they're telling us several times a month how lucky we are to have this job, how great it is, etc. You begin to realize that you, along with the rest of the sales floor, is sold by upper management on a daily basis. Things are carefully crafted and worded to put them in a more positive light to keep morale up, hints of promotions are thrown around liberally to inspire motivation and they always have an explanation/spin to negative press about the company, even if it's true. (Especially on the financial front)- Please, for the love of God, stop calling yourself a startup, Yelp. The company is way, way past that phase and is anything but at this point. It's a large public company and the employees do not have the freedoms/opportunities they would at a traditional, true startup. This goes back to the ping pong tables, kegs, casual dress etc. In reality, they're hardly, if ever used. The keg is strictly off limits until after 5:30, no one uses the ping pong table unless they're staying inside the office for lunch (which I would recommend always getting outside and getting fresh air, unless it's freezing of course) or staying late after work. They're nothing more than props to A) entice desperate college graduates on the job hunt and B) give a false sense of working at a fun, laid-back startup to current employees.Make no mistake, the sales floor is high pressure and metrics are painstakingly monitored. And depending on your manager, it can be even more stressful. Certain managers even make their reps work through lunch, which is illegal, but I guess that doesn't really matter to the company when its struggling to hit its revenue numbers like never before. I can't say it enough, Yelp is NOT a startup anymore.- Immature atmosphere. I think a lot of this goes back to the startup vibe. Most of the people on the sales floor have no idea what working at a startup is truly like, but they think they have this shiny, unique job at a \"tech company\" and it almost makes them overcompensate. We share a building with Credit Suisse and I kid you not, I would hear Yelp reps crack jokes daily about the Credit Suisse employees after they got off the elevator about their professional attire, their jobs, etc. Yes, let's make fun of the people making three times as much as we are. That makes a lot of sense.Also, the office can be extremely high school-like. Very gossipy, cliquey. All of that nonsense. Overall just lacking professionalism in that department far too often.- Territories. You're a slave to the system of territories. You will constantly be told that territories don't matter. Laugh every time you're told that. Territories absolutely matter. All of the best reps in the company have major metro areas like NYC, Boston, Chicago etc. If territories didn't matter, there wouldn't be certain managers who do shady things to get their reps the best territories possible. On top of that, because the company is under so much pressure to hit that magical billion in revenue, they are constantly hiring in large numbers. We're talking 70-80 people a class. Because of this, territories are getting smaller and accounts are being touched way too often. If you get a new territory, chances are the best accounts in it were touched no longer than 2 or 3 weeks ago.- It's very hard to sell against this company's reputation right now. The higher ups will tell you they've always had their share of obstacles, but reps who have been around since 2012 and 2013 will tell you it's noticeably more difficult than it's ever been right now. There's just too much anti-Yelp clout out there to make it all go away like they're aiming for. Most reps, like myself included, feel that if we don't close a business on the first call, we'll never close them. The reason being that they'll most likely go to Google when they're making their decision, and what they're going to see is nothing but negative. On top of that, the company as a whole is on the way down. It's not the \"next big thing\" or hot platform it was a few years ago. The stock is suffering and not going anywhere anytime soon.",
        "advice": "Be more honest and transparent.",
        "pros": "Oh, Yelp. What a rollercoaster you are. Let's get to it.- Overall, a lot of great people.

        "cons": "- The job gets incredibly monotonous and frustrating. Yelp is an incredibly tough sell. Business owners for the most part hate Yelp, don't know it, or love it and are already bought in. Getting a business owner to sit in front of a computer for 20 minutes is hard enough, but getting them to spend thousands of dollars on advertising with a contract is much harder.- Unfair territory/inventory rules. You'll get less\u2026\u00a0 credit for the same deal if your territory is in a small, rural area than a big city. It's also a much harder sell when these areas don't use the internet like people in big cities. Yelp is a consumer first platform, which affects sales numbers and leads to a lot of disappointed clients.- The culture really has taken a spiral since I've worked there. When the company was smaller, there was a fun loving culture where everyone knew everyone. As the company grew and the office got bigger, I would constantly see faces I've never seen before.- Low pay and unfair commission structure that doesn't make any sense. If a client cancels before their contract ends, it comes out of your commission.",

You'll learn a ton here (see below) and this will\u2026\u00a0 jump start a great future in sales if you work hard.- Good snacks (although the lunch options are sub par)- Great opportunity to grow in a sales career if you hit your numbers",
