        "cons": "** So why are so many Oracle employees so concerned about pay raises/not enough money? Let's take an UNBIASED look:(FYI: I'm talking on behalf of my department, I am NOT talking about every single department at Oracle)- Worked here for almost 6 years and NO pay raise. I'm in danger of losing my home, plus daycare, and other bills (Mortgage has gone up, daycare has gone up...). What can I do?!- We support \u2026\u00a0a workforce of thousands in the whole area and it can be VERY stressful. Which isn't so bad if we had better incentives.- 2 times I've gotten a bonus in my 5 years: A 25$ gift card to Chilli's, and a 10$ gift card to Starbuck's... I got a better bonus than some of my co-workers!- Departments here have a budget on which to pay the employees increases and bonuses. We were promised a pay increase percentage (To cope with rising costs), which kept getting reduced and reduced and reduced until it went to 0%. And guess who got the increases and bonuses? Upper management (I have a few contacts who have shown me this).- When I first came on board I was promised opportunity for growth (promotions, training, pay raises.). So we decided to to start a family, work on the house, etc. Now I can't EVEN put in anything into my 401K because I live paycheck to paycheck. Not to mention stock options and flex plans (I come from a poor family, I did NOT have a base I could start from. I've had to work up the ladder by myself with no IT or Business degree.).- Compared my salary to the exact same jobs around here using 3 different websites. I'm being paid 69% less than average. I repeat, I am NOT exagerating about my experiences with Oracle. These are jobs with the exact same responsibilities I have, except they support way less people than us.- Apart from the pay, chances for career growth are about 0.0001 %.- Recognition messages are just a bunch of words that are forgotten 2 minutes later.",

If when you get your paycheck you're left with a few dollars or in the negative (Not because of bad spending, but because you can't keep up with the rising co\u2026\u00a0sts)?
