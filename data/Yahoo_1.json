This continues to demoralize a lot of employees and one can feel it at the cafeteria. Asking folks to keep at it because that is the best thing to do is so lame.Chief Product Officer Blake may have some vision, but it is more theoretical than actionable. Many people talk\u2026\u00a0 about innovation, but an overall strategy is missing. Piecemeal solutions for iPad and other social efforts are not tied to an overall strategy. Even these efforts have stumbled at best. If Blake really means taking bold steps to reach 10-10-10 goals, then the senior leadership needs to take some bold steps and not just talk about them. To execute on such a vision, Yahoo needs leaders - not just managers - who first have the capability to speak the truth and face it.A lot of what is wrong at Yahoo has to do with two main reasons:1. There are a lot of people in positions where they should not be. There are senior managers in technical positions and they lack the knowledge to lead and drive teams. This blocks everyone and diminishes group performance. These managers continue to exist for a very long time because of their capability to play politics, spread gossips and build their own pyramids. Many managers and their superiors play the \"I scratch your back and you scratch mine\" during yearly reviews and continue to advance. Yearly reviews are mostly positive because the culture at Yahoo has gone soft and people are generally scared or just don't care to provide negative reviews or as these are better known as \"constructive feedback\". Either way the reviews continue to be fit people into curves so that compensation can be spread around. This leads to percolating only positive news upstream so that all looks good at least for a while. When things break, as they do there is a subtle finger pointing campaign to wash themselves fo the responsibility.2. Lack of or broken new product and innovation strategy. Yahoo continues to make money with what it already has. Nothing new has made money for Yahoo for a very long time. Internally, at the lowest level there are a lot of innovative ideas, but no clear way to get them out there. At the highest levels there is a clear lack of product strategy. Blake has talked about some big goals, but they lack an execution strategy.HR depart ment at Yahoo is very detached. There is no concept of employee development and training. Perhaps Yahoo has decided that it will be able to attract top talent for new initiative without having to invest in internal training initiatives.",
        "advice": "Review all managers who are not technical and determine whether they are in the right positions.

This will also help break the stranglehold of incompetent managers.Jerry Yang continues to be Chief Yahoo and his role has always been dubious.

During the recruiting/interview process Yahoo informed me the job would entail lots of detailed analyzing an\u2026\u00a0d helping clients to the full extent. I was informed that they would like me to learn some of the technical aspects of the job to start but with my background I will be promoted extremely fast. The recruiter even asked me to stop looking for employment after the interview. She said Yahoo really wanted me to join their team and asked me not to accept any other offers weeks prior to actually extending me the actual offer.Now fast forward to week 2 of training. My entire training class gets bamboozled with the information that the hours of operation are actually 7 days per week 6am to 9pm and we would be required to work every holiday.Next, the duties of this position were not Customer Service duties. I was resetting passwords all day. Management focused on how fast and how many calls you were taking rather than the content and quality of the calls. There were no details or analyzing. Not to mention they didn\u2019t want us helping customers to the full extent. Example, one day I had an elderly lady crying to me on the phone because she had a sick family member oversees and she didn\u2019t know how to respond to the email. Management wouldn\u2019t let me help her? I had to tell her to go to the help pages and figure it out herself.So as time goes by I discussed my concerns with management. I ask about future plans and maybe posting out or being promoted. I'm told, \u201cWe\u2019re learning as we grow & we don\u2019t really know what opportunities will be available in the future.\u201d Management clearly developed favorites and placed these favorite employees on special projects.

Somehow it has worked for quite a few years. The decision makers in HQ do not want to change them to keep a smooth sailing impression.

Too often the right had didn't know what the left hand was doing. Departments were siloed and had vested a vested interest in protecting their turf. The idea of \"One Yahoo!\" was floated for over a decade and will never come to fruition. Back in the day, we were a search\u2026\u00a0 company and our competition was Google. Then we became a media company, and our competition was Sony, EMI, and newspapers/magazines. Then we became a social media company and our competition was Facebook, for crying out loud. When I was forced out, we'd decided that we were no longer a media company but we weren't told what sort of company we were. I'd lived through 5 CEOs, including the resurrection of Jerry Yang, and wow, was THAT a worthless choice. There's a general consensus that Marissa didn't tell the Board that she was pregnant before they hired her. She hired her BFF out of Portugal (before he had the legal right to work in the US, of course, cuz the laws don't apply to Marissa and her senior staff), and very publicly threw him under the bus when she could no longer deny that he was out of his league. She's made some lame hiring decisions, and she's made some really horrible hiring decisions. EVERY offer passes through at least one hiring committee, and then is scrutinized by Marissa. If she doesn't like the comp (and she often doesn't), she will reduce it to what she thinks is fitting and there is no appeal. She talks about hiring the best and the brightest but neither the best nor the brightest will surrender their right to negotiate their compensation. Anyone who does so cannot, by definition, be either the best or the brightest. Free food goes only so far. Oh, and cutting work from home while claiming that it only affected 100 people, most of whom, according to you, rarely logged into the network to actually work seems a little like overkill. Friday 430 pm all-hands meetings is also a nice touch, especially when if you show up at 4:31pm, security will not unlock the doors to let you in.The employee population have also gone from reasonably nice/decent to an unattractive assortment of narcissists and ego maniacs who seem to take out their frustration of having no work-life balance and being constantly under the gun and under threat of getting a poor quarterly review that they can take it out on their co-workers.

        "cons": "Quarterly Performance Reviews (QPRs): They are as awful as you've heard. Every quarter you go through a full-on review cycle. That means having to spend a lot of time justifying the work you've done, a lot of time filling out peer reviews for your coworkers, and a lot of time generally worrying about your status there. Yahoo! uses a stack-ranking system where everyone is ranked from first to worst. Everyone is put in\u2026\u00a0to a bell curve and all slots in that curve must be filled. That means that if you're on a high performing team you may wind up in the lower quartiles even if you do good work. When I worked there if you wound up one standard deviation to the right for two consecutive quarters you were put on a PIP. I've heard from friends who still work there that now if you wind up in a lower quartile on *one* QPR you're not put on a PIP, you're simply fired. That's right folks, one bad quarter and you're out. They pretend that the reviews are objective, but they're not. How can they be? It's a nasty political system. If you're not into that, stay away.The company has been sputtering along for 8 years now. Despite many many changes in top leadership and lots of big talk, nothing has really changed. Yahoo! is always a takeover target. There is always a threat of layoffs, although now with the harsh QPR system there's a constant stealth layoff going on.Also as I was leaving I noticed that a new harsher, nastier engineering culture was taking hold there. Engineers talked gleefully of \"getting rid of the dead weight\" (translation: mass firings). If you weren't absolutely stellar you were crap.If you're anything less than a top-tier engineer, stay away. Your life there won't be pleasant. If you are a top-tier engineer, stay away, there are *much* better companies in the valley where you can really shine.If you need a job out of college, it's probably a fine place to go.

        "cons": "- A bright future....in the rearview mirror. Yahoo has spent a decade squandering its future, and is now close to checkmate. Platitudes like 'mobile first' and 'delighting our customers' don't really address the systemic issues at this company. The recent foray into online gambling shows how desperate this company is to shore up its sagging revenue - the primary value of Yahoo is its stake in Alibaba and its Asian as\u2026\u00a0sets.- Corporate ineptitude at its finest. The leadership is non-existent, and C-level leadership mixes incompetence with arrogance and lies. The CEO will tell you she doesn't force her leadership teams to stack rank employees, but ask any front-line manager, and you'll see this is a lie.- QPRs...employees are evaluated on a quarterly basis. Sounds good, right? Not when the evaluations are stack ranked, and there's a forced distribution of achieves vs. misses. So if you're on a team of idiots, you're as good as gold...if you work on a team of smart achievers, you might draw the short straw. And make no mistake - that short straw will result in your termination at some point, or at the very least, you'll have to wait over a year for a raise or promotion. Since forced distribution is a zero sum game, it encourages employees to sabotage each other in an effort to avoid the ax.- Ya-who? Not only is Yahoo somewhat of a joke in most of society, they are going through a painful, existential identity crisis. Of the last four CEOs, none has been able to coherently articulate an answer to \"What does Yahoo do?\".- Layoffs. Yahoo has yet to improve its revenue, so the only other road to profitability is to cut expenses. That means cutting people. For a while in Q1, there were weekly layoffs - management doesn't have the guts to make a large cut, so they cut 20 here, 30 there and hope nobody notices. Everyone noticed.- Lack of communication and transparency. Weekly 'FYI' meetings are supposed to allow employees a chance to ask questions of management - while great in theory, this is just a waste of an hour when the answers are glib coporatisms from the PR department, or complete avoidance of the actual question being asked. Q: 'What are you going to do about QPRs? They're destroying morale at Yahoo'. A: 'I fundamentally disagree, I think morale is great'. It sure is great if you're bringing in the millions in the C-suite! For the drones, maybe not as much.- Terrible products. Try using Yahoo mail alongside Gmail. 'nuff said. Fantasy football is the one bright spot, but even that will probably crash just as you're about to draft your QB.",
        "advice": "Resign. Now. Publicly. You're cool, Ken Goldman - you can stay. The rest of the C-suite should be ashamed of calling themselves leaders.Maybe too harsh. Here are some real pieces of advice:- Eliminate stack ranking and subsequent firings. It didn't work at GE or Microsoft. Doesn't seem to be working at Yahoo either.- Stop buying companies that you won't actually monetize to their full potentia\u2026\u00a0l. Brightroll? Sounds like a good acquisition. Tumblr? Try actually making some money off it!- Roll back the regressive work at home policies. This is 2015, and you're (supposedly) an internet company. Webex works fine, and let's face it - the real impediment to collaboration is the toxic work culture, not people working from their homes.- Develop a coherent and specific statement about what Yahoo is, and what it's going to do in the future. Want to be an internet company? Great. Want to be a media company? Awesome. Pick one and stick to it. And dump the 'mobile first' thing - that's the equivalent of saying 'as a company, we want to be relevant and make money'. No need to pay millions of dollars for leadership to say something so vague.",
