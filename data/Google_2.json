If you have ever dreamed of working in a company where you are rarely held accountable for anything, Google is the place to be. The 6 hour days, the inexperienced managers, the joy in reinventing the wheel, the ability to destroy a co-worker by the mere mention of being \"un-Googly\" (In the years I worked at Google I still haven't the slightest ide\u2026\u00a0a what \"Googly\" means.

Unfortunately, there's too many glassy-eyed Google cultists/lifers who are willing to overwork themselves for a 35% (or more) paycut on projects that may not actually go anywhere. Despite claiming to seek openness, management keeps a lot of secrets-- especially around performance reviews (all emplo\u2026\u00a0yees are graded and rank-ordered, but employees don't get to know how well they fared).In terms of actual productive work, employees are demoralized by having direction constantly changed. I suppose this is known as \"keeping us on our toes.\" Further, it's tiring to hear every team say that they're acting as their own startup within Google, and that team members are going to be hand-picked to be involved in such a prestigious project. It's not uncommon for entire teams to be uprooted or replaced in one fell swoop. Put together, this leads to an uneasy feeling about one's job stability.One final problem: too many Googlers are young, inexperienced, and short-sighted in their understanding of how much power they actually have in developing public-facing products. They don't understand the implications of their actions, and move too quickly to consider them.",

Unlike many companies, where employee productivity is dependent already having a certain set of skills needed to get the job done, Google encourages (if not expected) employees to spend a majority of their time doing things they don't currently know how to do. In effect, you are getting \u2026\u00a0paid to learn new skills, and due to the \"act now, think later\" Google mindset, it's generally okay to make mistakes as you learn. World-renowned industry experts regularly lecture at Google, giving the campus an even stronger college-like feel. And in terms of the perks, it's surprisingly nice to not have to think about packing a lunch, to be able to borrow a free car to run an errand, and to wash your stinky gym clothes after working out your frustrations in the weight room.",

        "cons": "The days when Google was the coolest place in the world to work are gone. Google is deteriorating at the edges. Many managers at Google got their jobs just by having low employee numbers and are otherwise unqualified. Once entrenched they tend to show little concern for their reports, concerning themselves with \"managing up\" to their own manager. Google is supposed to have a project matrix where tech leads are peers,\u2026\u00a0 not managers, but managers commonly flout this and micromanaging is endemic. Moving between projects is limited by complex procedures and is rarely attempted. In satellite offices the selection of projects to work on is limited and to make matters worse it is discouraged for engineers to work on projects not centered in their own offices. Being friends with your manager is a more effective way to get promoted than showing competence. In fact, showing too much competence or initiative is a good way to earn the ire of your manager. Performance evaluation is supposed to be by peer review but in reality, feedback from peers is ignored and only the manager's rating is taken seriously. Political infighting and character assassination are increasingly the norm at Google. Managers turn a blind eye to it, perhaps because they have found such techniques useful in developing their own careers. Google base compensation is on the low side, and is supposed to be more than made up for by incentive bonuses, but these are largely illusionary because few employees receive the necessary \"exceeds expectations\" performance evaluation. Managers at Google tend to consider themselves special people, better than engineers. Few will bother to greet or otherwise acknowledge the existence of anybody other than another manager if they pass them in the hall. Except for the weekly TGIF cross-company sessions where the founders candidly answer questions from all employees, management at Google is increasingly secretive about procedures and plans.",

Stop listening to the voices of managers telling you what a great job they are doing, because their main skill is self promoti\u2026\u00a0on. They don't care about the welfare of the company or their reports, only about themselves. From their point of view the system is working well because they are free to do as they please. The situation has already deteriorated to the point where many of the best engineers plan to leave as soon as their initial stock awards finish vesting.

As a result, people did what they wanted, which was not always most profitable (in part because short term incentives don't align with long term profitability)\u2026\u00a0. This created a lot of problems. In 2007, the company created a new layer of middle-manager jobs and hired people internally...without training them to be managers! Disaster. Lots of inefficiency and broken promises. Horrible decision that continues to plague employees. There are some good managers, I just didn't work with any.-No career development. Minimal worthwhile training. You can take a course here and there, but when it comes to moving around the company, watch out. Sales, Engineering, and Enterprise are silos---you can't move between them. *Everyone* complains about this. Smart people have for years been talking about leaving.-They fired most of HR in 2009 (the others have always been contract workers without benefits); what remains of HR is really weak. HR is never helpful anyway.-No one \"owns\" decisions (not even managers or their managers!), but everyone gets a say...so few risks get taken and greatness rarely evolves beyond the idea stage-There's a lot of mediocrity; why improve when improvement might require you or teammates to work a little smarter or harder? Lots of resistance to change that requires more work.-Flat organization is bad for people whose work shows skill beyond job level / area & typical promotion cycles (senior management encouraged national sales team to think of lateral moves as promotions...even though you don't make more money, get better titles--and then must start the promotion journey afresh as if you had never worked there before)-Salary. When Google offered me the job, a well-known, respected web property with a similar job did as well. The latter offered me TWICE as much money as Google. Twice! And all the good benefits.-Salary increases over time. When you're promoted, you don't make all that much more. Bonuses are small (and taxed at 50%). Options are not worth as much as you think. And you don't get as much stock as you think, either. (These are taxed at 50%, too, so you don't really get very much!)All of this relates to the non-engineering side.

I can make a\u2026\u00a0n analysis that makes it look great ) - even if not explicit the pressure to please powerful VPs in Eng is intense. This is compounded by the hyper-reliance on 360 feedback and networking which means it can be hard to make a change or stand up if something seems wrong.Finance is primarily full of investment bankers & consultants, with little folks with actual Corp Finance experience. This causes an amazing amount of inefficiency as folks don't understand how to do basic things like create a budget and expect people to stick to it (seriously - within weeks of budget creation no one knows if budget applies anymore or if we're moving to a monthly forecast view instead). At first, I tried very hard to get more Corp Finance folks in the org but now I actually think IBankers do best as folks with actual CF experience tend to be so shocked by the Google processes (or lack thereof) they simply cannot hang.Work/life balance is dreadful - since the employee base is generally young and former bankers, most folks don't seem to be upset by late nights stretching past midnight but for those with families (or even those that just enjoy their lives outside of work) this can be painful. Especially since most of the time is spent on projects that go nowhere.Google elects not to use ERP or other established software in favor of developing their own solutions. Then they don't staff these solutions with adequate Eng resources. Result is an incredible lack of data availability with the expectation that finance be \"scrappy\" to find ways to tease out or completely guess at the data. Upside is that without a data source no one's likely to know if you're completely off base - but this can be unsettling for folks who really want to use reliable info to make business decisions.There are constant reorgs and reprioritizations at Google - particularly if you don't support the Search / Ads business. Forget about focusing on anything that will take more than 1 Q to achieve.This is a social/extroverted environment which means that those who are good at networking have an edge over those who don't, even if the folks who don't are doing a superior job.

I'm in great shape, but the jobs performed by Operations Associates and Engineers such as myself, require extreme physical exertion in order to keep up. My hands are no longer hands, but machines in need of desperate repair. I have callouses so thick that I cannot feel my fingertips. My hands ache terribly each day and are so mangled it feels like I have an extreme case of rheumatoid arthritis or perhaps I do from all the manual labor!- HOT!! The Data Center is kept at a temperature so hot, about 30 minutes into working, I am wanting to take a break to grab some Vitamin Water or any water for that matter. There are no water fountains and there is only one area which is typically far away in which employees are able to store water that must be in a CamelBack thermos. Every work area is extremely hot unless you're lucky enough to have a desk job.- Employees? It's interesting that the majority of actual work is done by workers who are not true Google employees. Temporary workers outnumber permanent Googlers by far. These individuals are interviewed for an entry level position by Google Management, but are actually employed by a Temp Agency. These poor saps are underpaid, overworked, and all are fighting for a permanent position that most will not obtain. They do the same work as many Operations Associates & Engineers. But receive no promise for their hard work and are unappreciated by management. Management is not allowed to give temporary workers any type of feedback as to their performance and are unable to pull them aside to tell them they are doing a good job, nor room for improvement.",

        "cons": "I'm used to startup culture, and I had a serious culture shock coming to Google. Maybe it varies somewhat by team, but from my vantage point, engineering seemed very bloated and bureaucratic. There is an obscenely long and restrictive \"style guide\" of programming rules that must be followed and company-wide banned language features that makes coding much less productive than I'm used to. Code reviews sometimes become\u2026\u00a0 bickerfests and can drag on for weeks or months. The allocation of engineers to teams is awful - my recruiter basically lied about what I would be working on, when I arrived I was assigned to a team and project that I had no interest in whatsoever, and there was nothing I could do about it except suck it up until I could leave. My coworkers were extremely risk-averse and were far more concerned about breaking something that already worked than about making progress. Also the culture is biased towards \"perfect\" engineering solutions, and just hacking to get something done is highly frowned upon. This isn't always bad, and you can learn good programming practices and discipline, but unfortunately it just isn't always practical in the real world of deadlines and needing to make progress.The worst part of all is that I never felt like my work mattered anyway to the success of the company. I worked on various projects that my manager assigned (there wasn't much discretion in choosing things to work on, and the vaunted 20% time is just hype), and my manager had a lot of \"pet projects\" that he wanted done but didn't really have any great justification for why they should be done at all.Anyway Google is a big company and managers and teams vary in quality.
