The climate can be very emotionally overwhelming, loud, and overly stimulating...yeah you are probably t\u2026\u00a0hinking I am some sensitive shmuck! But the daily traffic gets overwhelming when you are responsible for dealing with angry customers daily in an environment where you have little support! Managers are inconsistent in implementing company policy, constantly making exceptions for customers who scream and disrespect employees. THERE IS NEVER ENOUGH EMPLOYEES ON THE FLOOR!! BUT MANAGEMENT EXPECTS US TO HELP 4-6 PEOPLE AT ONCE TO MAKE UP FOR IT. LASTLY; moving up in the company is extremely difficult! there are many lateral promotions that warrant no pay raise, but managers are extremely inconsistent in their reasoning for promoting people. You could have perfect numbers and attendence but they will give the promotion to someone who has worse numbers but just sucks up to them more and they will give you a lame reason such as \"we think you need to work on your peer to peer relationships\" (happened to several of my co-workers) THERE ARE NO REAL BEARRINGS FOR PROMOTIONS. AND MOST \"PROMOTIONS\" ARE LATERAL AND ALLOW YOU TO WORK HARDER AND DO MORE IN THE STORE WITHOUT GETTING PAID A CENT MORE...THEY HAVE A REALLY WONDERFUL WAY OF TRICKING YOU INTO FEELING LIKE YOU SHOULD BE THANKFUL AND HAPPY THEY GRANTED YOU WITH THIS OPORTUNITY!!! AND THEN DURING THE REVIEW THEY WILL COMMENT ON HOW YOU DON'T SMILE ENOUGH IN YOUR NEW ROLE AND THEY ARE WORRIED YOU ARE GETTING BURNED OUT................AFTER GETTING YELLED AT BY A CUSTOMER EVER HOUR THAT DOESNT WANT TO OBIDE BY THE COMPANY POLICY, AND THEN AFTER THAT CUSTOMER SCREAMS AT YOU AND DEMANDS A MANAGER THE MANAGER GIVES THEM EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANT! MAKING YOU LOOK LIKE THE BAD GUY WHEN THEY TOLD YOU TO UPHOLD COMPANY POLICY! IT CAN BE HARD TO KEEP SMILING! BUT WHEN AN EMPLOYEE NEEDS AN EXCEPTION MADE FOR THEM???OOOOHHHH NOOOOO....THE POLICY IS WAY MORE IMPORTANT THEN!!! They say they want to give you more personal development training time but you have to FIGHT for it!ONE MORE THING!

Stop hiring your higher management from other lack luster retail shops... unless of course you want to become like them. They bring plenty of bad habits with them and want nothing more than to apply their existing formula to the Apple stores.Your successful stores capitalize on th\u2026\u00a0e organic growth that happens among the employees in the store. That is the magic of the Apple Store; the unique retail environment the employees create. When you try to shove policy and bland retail marketing across the board to every employee... the store loses it's individuality and it struggles to find its identity constantly. This becomes incredibly distracting for the employee and distracts from the goal of hitting their metrics and performing.",

Managers wanted us to follow th\u2026\u00a0e company policy 100% without no hesitation. However, if we were doing our part and a customer was angry, then they would throw a tantrum and the managers would give into them All the Time and make Us Specialists look like the Bad Guys!!! I have seen times when a customer caused a scene because they couldn't return their two year old phone. As a result, the manager would give in and also give them a free phone case. The policy is 14 days and the policy never sticks. When it came to making an exception for an employee. OOOO Noooo But the Policy!!! Many of my co-workers were frustrated with the mixed messages of management.During my time there, out store had a really harsh Time and Attendance Policy. If you were late or call out no matter the reason you would get an occurrence. The subway could of shut down or you might of had a death in the family, doesn't matter!!! Many great employees were fired because of this broken policy.They had system called the NPP where the customers can rate you. This was one of the reasons I left. Your raise is dependent on this. The store can be way understaffed and a customer can write a negative review about the experience ( not having control over it) so that effects your raise. Also, Management wants you to sell as much AppleCare or One to One as possible. You can convince a customer to buy it without being pushy at all. Then later on the customer will have buyers remorse and slam you by giving you a negative NPP score by saying \"they were too pushy\". Then I would be blamed by the managers for being too pushy and getting a detractor. If I didn't Applcare then they would ask me to please improve my numbers.

        "cons": "Favoritism in retail, people getting promoted who didn't deserve it, moving up the retail ladder requires lots of lateral moves, pay is alright but not great, if you speak a language, they milk it. I've worked retail for 10+ years and I thought Apple would be totally different. I thought it would be an easier foot in the door into apple corporate. Just be careful, apple is VERY selective to who they promote into corp\u2026\u00a0orate (certain positions), plus your manager needs to give you a good work if they decide to promote you and its just like any other retail jobs. The perks make it semi-tollerable.**Use your 2nd language to leverage more pay when negotiating pay in retail, especially if you speak Chinese or Spanish, very high customer volume in stores here in the Bay Area, California **",
        "advice": "Don't micromanage, don't talk down to the associates (Some managers, not all), We all have favorites but please don't make it so obvious as to who you do favor, promotions or even lateral moves need to be carefully evaluated. Some people don't deserve them but they happen. I tried to become a 'Creative and I did many in-store initiatives to make my way there. However, numerous people got promoted to the next steps ov\u2026\u00a0er me who didn't deserve it or didn't work as hard as myself.",
        "pros": "The perks, the benefits (only if your offered the full time role), stock options, Apple Passport, discounts on Apple goods and also third parties product discounts.",
        "summary": "Apple Retail: Great in the beginning but turned out to be just like any other job.",
