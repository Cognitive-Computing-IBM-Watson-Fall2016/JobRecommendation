        "cons": "Work -life balance is in vast majority of roles is not possible. Exceptions are HR,IT, Finance, accounting and recruiting but growth opportunity in those exception roles are a lot smaller.Leadership principles are to set impossible goals but allow failures .Depending on your personality type this can be a \"pro\" In some instances this allows you to get the absolute max out of the different teams. I.e. if I ask\u2026\u00a0 something that will take 100% of the teams time and effort I might miss out on hidden resources in the team so to ensure nothing is missed I ask for a 200% effort as goal. The team produces a 110% output but falls short of the 200%goal. It is a failure but still a 10% increase. That is the logic behind it. The drawback is that in some cases short sighted decisions are made in the effort to reach the 200% goal. This often ends up costing more than realistic goals would. This process also ends up consuming and burning out a lot of resources leading to high turn over. This, in turn, causes a lot of organizations within Amazon repeat many basic mistakes over and over as the lessons learned are not maintained as the experienced/burned resources have left.Company culture. A bit \"cult\" inclined similar to Apple in the Steve Jobs days.Opinions and issue reports of VP's (no matter how small) and above are treated with utmost urgency and attention. Teams have on average 1-2 fire drills per month with VP escalations. This normally involves a min 3-4 people dropping current tasks with max 1 hours notice to work day, night and weekends to root cause issues spanning from setup to product. Daily or twice a day status updates in terms of full fledged presentations are not uncommon.Company benefits. Not a huge decision factor but helps team bonding to be better in other companies that what I have seen in Amazon. One of the Amazon principles are \"frugal\" which was later changed to \"do more with less\". Meaning that they are not spending money on comfort items like \"economy plus\" tickets for long haul business flights, decent cafeteria food vendors, snacks, beverages, subsidized food for late night overtime work, health activities and other small benefits that helps increase employee satisfaction. Team building activities and events are under tight budget restrictions normally limiting it to affordable dinner and movie tickets. Although employees aren't paid to have fun at the office, they are there to work there is a certain lack of camaraderie in Amazon groups and organization that I have always experienced in other companies which I think is a factor to some people when deciding who to work for as you will be spending a substantial part of your life in the office.Expectation is that you bring work with you home and can support late night calls on a daily basis. If you are an exempt employee you should be prepared to explain and justify why you are not available outside office hours and weekends to support standby and crunch work.Please note that you are willing to adjust to these expectations you have great growth opportunities but it might not be for everyone. What I have seen it mostly employees with small kids or sick family members getting bad reviews for not being \"team players\" or supporting conference calls in other time zones or putting in the \"informal standard\" 50 hour work week and more during crunch times.",
        "advice": "Apply principles and expectations equally across organization. The company principles tend to be used as tools to create ownership and accountability down to the lowest instance of employees in the company. Which is great way to ensure all take their tasks and responsibilities I.e. it takes away the ability for the employee to hold their manager accountable for any shortcomings or mistakes. For example \"you didn't kn\u2026\u00a0ow what was more important to work on?\" the Amazon principles \"ownership, are right, a lot,bias for action\" means that you should find this out for yourself and drive us to success. Is your manager wrong? Then you own the responsibility to make sure he and all others realizes that they are wrong. The issue comes in when the principles ownership is applied a lot harsher in the lower layers of the company hierarchy. There are a lot of mistakes made in the company but it is very rarely there is accountability and ownership taken for this in the higher segments. It creates a fair amount of misogyny and a lot of time spent by employees to cover for themselves rather than focusing on solving problems.Apply or instate a new principle called \"common sense\". With the unique company culture and size which Amazon has, it is easy to get lost in this kind of alternate reality. Much of this alternate reality tend to be incompatible with external collaboration partners and vendors. It is important to raise the bar but in certain cases some moderation or compromises could be explored in the effort to get there. Certain layers of executive management tend to loose anchor points with reality. I think it could be attributed to the way exec escalations are treated internally leaning a bit more towards a fundamentalist view of how the world and industry should operate. Though this Amazonian close to religious conviction is admirable, in certain cases it makes it very hard to collaborate in a productive way.",
        "pros": "Competitive compensationHigh visibilityGrowth opportunities are abundant and rewarded due to high attrition and turn over of employees compared to other companies of Amazon's size.Decent IT support infrastructure (above average of other companies)Feedback system -everyone in the company can input feedback about anyone.

They can't read reports right because they come out saying one thing and really mean another. 4) managers don't know where anything is or how to do something fully.

I and many of my peers completed multiple projects not because they were well planned or properly resourced, but because we were dedicated professionals who wouldn't let them fail. Dedicated professionals will only do this so long as they think the company has their back. Driving employees like this is the status quo at Amazon, and it is a primary reason why attrition is high. When I left I was more senior than 78% of the work force. Most employees will not see the majority of their stock options because Amazon back loads the payout.

I was shocked to see how insidious\u2026\u00a0 the lure of a change in status of employment from part time seasonal to a permanent Amazon hire was used to basically trick the unsuspecting employee into reducing hours for the company. Since the change, I see understaffing to the point that the managers have to pick product and the associate that has hours has to work at a fever pitch just to keep up with the demand.When the service launched there were,on average, eight employees on shift. Now there may be two and in some cases one. That is very abusive. One more thing. The managers do not care that you have been picking product from the time you clock in. Once you finish the task of picking and slamming products the expectation is that because they are so short staffed and need to have product put away or stowed they continue the grind you into the dirt...until your break, which you will need because the warehouse is so hot you drip sweat.",

        "cons": "As for the insurance benefits, for a company the size of Amazon.com, and with as many subsidiaries that they own, they should have been able to hire someone who could have negotiated a much better deal for their group insurance rates for anyone with a family. I've worked at smaller employers, with nowhere near the employee capital leverage that Amazon.com can command, and they provided much better insurance for famil\u2026\u00a0ies or Parents w/children, at much lower rates.again, as long as you're single, or only have a spouse/domestic partner...and that spouse/domestic partner is able to/willing to move. If you have children, or your spouse/partner can't/won't move for whatever reason, then you better have a college degree to move up within any real time frame. In my 4 years of being at Amazon.com, I knew of many Tier 3's who had been at Amazon for 5 years, maxing out their pay, before they were promoted. For me, that's just too long to be in one place, with less than a dollar raise per year, to be on one position.....Unless you were some one if the opposite sex of who wanted you to fill a Tier 3 role (that's right, sexist behavior) or Unless you have a degree...Add that in and I've known of a dozen or more who were promoted within 18 months or so. That doesn't count the number of newly hired Area Managers that were only able to do the job because of the Tier 3's in the area, and then still fail and before being fired, start going on write up spree's to prove they can be better managers. Amazon doesn't have a formal policy for having to have a college degree to be promoted, but even if you have more than a decade in direct management, don't think you'll be promoted to an actual AM position, at Tier 4 or above, unless you have a degree.The shares of stock (Stock Bonus) that you receive, only twice, as a Tier 1 (or even after being promoted to Tier 3) employee is nice, but tons of employers offer far better bonus options, however, tons of employers also offer NO bonus options.As for the monthly bonus that you MAY receive, it's far from guaranteed, and seems to be skewed to benefit employees who don't have children to take care of (single parents), or a handicapped/sick spouse, parent, or have to have another main priority other than Amazon. If you use your Unpaid Personal Time, then the small monthly bonus that you MAY receive is docked by 50%. Use that time twice and you lose it.As for Leave, different facilities may have different requirements for approving the leave, forget that some states and federal laws require that it is provided in certain instances. Even if you have the correct documentation, then you can still be denied FMLA. I know, it's a serious accusation, but it's completely true. And their Ethics line complaints? well, maybe i depends on who deals with your complaints, but no one that I knew of ever was able to have anything happen (unless it was a Tier 1, who were sometimes fired as a result of theft)As for the Tuition/education program, it's not bad, but changing it to allow for earning, at least, an Associate degree, since you can actually earn it from some programs, or with some college (from before Amazon), and it would really be great.the Pay structure is somewhat odd, I've worked with temps, who have less experience, and knew than me, but made $2.00 per hr more than I did..Why? I had more responsibility expected of me but I actually made less than someone who was able to skate by doing as little as possible, making as much as possible. Amazon makes an attempt to vary pay increases by looking at other employers in the area and calculating other benefits, giving an extra quarter (sometimes less, or more than that).And one more thing...if you think that once you're promoted to a higher position, (Tier3 or up,) you could ever skate by with only getting your regular 40 hours, forget it, as an AM or higher, you hae to put in a TON of extra hours, so kiss your kids, wife, and anyone else in your life goodbye.",
        "advice": "As the American workplace continues to change, you'll need to change the way in which you promote, or change the way you pay the lowest employees. Amazon will get bad employees, who only want to collect a check, putting more stress on the Managers, who will pass that stress along to the good employees, not making as much as the temps. Then because that employee learned a few things at Amazon, they'll leave because th\u2026\u00a0ey don't make enough money, from limited and quickly maxed out pay, or from inability to be promoted within a decent time frame. That means eventually, someone who doesn't know as much will fill that position, with the problems only rolling downhill from there.Amazon is a pretty darn good company, in spite of their size, but some serious changes need to be made with respect to pay, promotion, and holding higher up HR employees responsible for enforcing FMLA policy",
        "pros": "Your hard work gets noticed, by Managers and Tier 3s alike (Tier 3 is a position that is somewhat equivalent to an Assistant Manager at other employers, but they directly manage the bulk of resources in the areas that they're assigned). You can be trained in other areas in your working area if those above you think you can handle it. At date of hire, you receive up to 4 days off, in the form of -1-10 hr block of Vaca\u2026\u00a0tion Time, 1-10 hr block of Paid Personal Time, and 20 hrs of Unpaid Personal Time.Vacation time must be submitted for approval no less than 24 hours before the time you wish to be off, the Paid personal time can be used whenever you like, and the same with the Unpaid Personal time. You get up to two weeks , 1 week of vacation and 1 week of paid personal, and every quarter, you accrue 2 extra unpaid days. You can have up to 80 hours of unpaid time accrue before you max out, you lose all of your 1 week personal time if you don't use it by the end of the year, and my understanding is that vacation time can be accrued for an unlimited amount of time. After your first year, you receive double the amount of vacation time to accrue throughout the year. Remember, all of that time takes the whole year to accrue, so every pay period, you get a little more that you can use in whatever type of increments you decide. Insurance Benefits aren't too bad, if you're single, or have a spouse/domestic partner... If you have a family, still not the worst that I've seen, but fairly standard...(See Below) For advancement and promotional capabilities, Amazon.com is also great if you're single and/or have a specific type of spouse/domestic partner...(See Below) 401 K is pretty standard for the industrial warehousing industry. After being there for predetermined amounts of time (2 years, then 3 years), you receive a few units of stock at both intervals, which is nice...(see below) You MAY receive a small monthly bonus, based on the whole facility performance, so that's definitely good..(See Below)Amazon.com also has tons of Leave types available for emergency situations or personal issues, but really could benefit from enforcing the laws concerning certain types of leave...(See Below)They also have an Ethics Line, for employees who feel like they're being slighted, or have seen something they feel or know is wrong. (See Below)Tuition Reimbursement - WONDERFUL... Amazon has a pretty good tuition program. You have to be an Amazonian for over a year before it can be used, but they'll pay up to 12k for certain college courses, usually a technical certificate, or Certificate of some kind. It's supposed to be up to 3K, spread out over a years time, but they're pretty flexible on that because of the limited number of available programs that you can finish over a few years time period... And they also pay for your text books related to the program/classes you're taking. Really, really nice.Pay isn't bad, for a warehouse, unskilled, position either...starting out.(See Below)In the end, Amazon.com isn't a bad place to work, it's really great for hardworking, high achieving, single people, or people who don't have families, or people with a college degree BEFORE you start at AMAZON.",

Feels like slavery and prison all at once, without th\u2026\u00a0e whiplashes. The Inbound department is very disorganized and you will get confused and get blamed for mistakes that are not your fault. It is the worst department to work in and they have a very high turnover rate.",

It's not fair that a new employee should be subjected to verbal abuse simply because they did not receive the correct training. Also, HR should not tell employees when they start that this place does not tolerate harassment. My first week there, I was harassed by a janitor an\u2026\u00a0d had to fill out two statements before they finally left me alone and I had a witness. I was treated very disrespectfully by my co-workers as well. Try to be more for your people and not so much your numbers, especially the Inbound team.",
