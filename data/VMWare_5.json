As a 4.5 billion $$ company, of course it's a lot bigger than a start up, but I think there's a really good opportunity to build tools, structure and process to enable the next stage of growth from 4 B - 8 B and I'm psyched to be a part of it.These impressions are based on having been a consultant at VMware for 18 months and now a full time employee for 3 weeks.",
