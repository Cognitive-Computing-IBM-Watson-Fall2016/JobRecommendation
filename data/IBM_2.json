In the US, there is very little training given, as they seem to be investing heavily in training the \"global\" resources. The former CEO made a statement at the beginning of 2012 that US workers are not willing to learn anything new so they have had to turn to global resources. There are many IBMers in the US willing and eager to learn, but there is only so much you can do with free computer based training and little investment in classroom training.When taking vacations or going on extended assignments, it is your responsibility to find someone else to cover your duties and responsibilities (which is hard if you are the only person on your team who does what you do).

Managers care about the bottom line and how many hours you're able to log, and not whether or not projects are a good fit for you. The upward mobility requires you to be at over 100% utilization, as well as the ability for you to \"sell yourself\" wi\u2026\u00a0thin the company. This results in a lot of fancy terminology thrown around by people who may not know anything about the topic - i.e. \"process improvement.\"There is no work/life balance, but if you're young you can give a couple years here for experience. A band 6 should go to a band 7 in 2 years, but this really depends on whether or not you're able to BS well on your assessments, and whether or not your project manager supports that BS. Going from a band 6 to a 7, in the 2 years it takes you to get there, means a paltry raise and a new title - not much more to it than that. You'll also bill at different rates, so band 7s might have problems getting on a project where all they're looking for is a clerk.",

        "cons": "IBM has lost its shine. I am certain that Thomas Watson continues to turn in his grave as to what has happened to his company. IBM has long moved away from gaining new ideas and starting businesses from scratch to one of acquisitions. As products move through their life cycle, the work is outsourced to places like India where IBM can reduce its labor cost. The net affect is that the employees are discarded as the pro\u2026\u00a0ducts they have built and supported are no longer generating the revenue they once were. New opportunities exist only in locations where companies that were acquired are located. Unless you have experience with the products from the companies acquired and are willing to relocate, your future at IBM is limited. IBM is a pro at reducing its labor through layoffs while minimizing the publicity of downsizing and outsourcing. Once you see the death spiral begin at your site (especially sites that have been around a long time), be proactive and find a new opportunity elsewhere. It may seem daunting at first, especially the longer you have stayed at IBM, but in the long run you will be better off (and much happier too).",
