        "cons": "Like any tech company, the work is big and complicated so work/life balance can suffer from time to time. The difference is that it's the passion within the individuals that drives them to work long hours and forego time off. Of course there can be times when schedule demands force the imbalance, but it's not such that 10-12 hours days become commonplace and expected regardless. We do what we do to get the job done; \u2026\u00a0no one is killing themselves because there's an order to do so.Being able to eat to your hearts/stomachs content can be dangerous to the waistline, but that's a self-control thing and not the company's issue.",
        "advice": "Keep doing what you're doing and fight hard to not be complacent. I believe that humility is the key so don't ever lose that thinking. Your motives will always be suspect, but if you're able to look in the mirror everyday and know that your motives are pure, that's all that matters. Walking the talk is the best evidence there is.",
        "pros": "I'm a 55 year old working in a company where the average age is 28, and I've never been happier. I have always wanted to work in a company where I wasn't the proverbial square peg, and after nearly 30 years in the work force, I believe that I have found the company that complements my ideology for how a company should operate. Here are the \"Pros\" as I see them...- Leadership: Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg,\u2026\u00a0 Chris Cox and the rest of the leadership team. Inspiring, smart and totally real.- The Culture: The openness is a real thing, we're trusted to do the right thing, mistakes are expected, being yourself is important and encouraged, humility is encouraged and expected, building trust is paramount, the mission of making the world a more open and connected place isn't just a cool phrase because it guides everything. It's not about us, it's about everyone else.- The People: Smart and nice is what I find. The diversity is better than any other company I've worked at and it's getting better. Those that are figuring out how to make what we do better for everyone are really good at implementing their ideas. Two years ago I didn't know what this company really was or if it had a secure future. I can clearly see now that they have what it takes to last, and it's sincere.- Management: Managers are hired because they're good managers and not because they're good at something else. The management track is different than the contributor track and they're equal in importance.- Benefits: Working in the Valley it's hard to differentiate all the benefits employees receive and Facebook is at least equal to all the major tech companies, but coming from Seattle the benefits are nothing short of incredible.Granted, I haven't been with the company for very long and I'm still in the honeymoon period, but I can tell what's real and what's not; this place is for real.",

        "cons": "FB expects a lot out of engineers, and you can't slack off. Of course, you shouldn't slack off at any job, but since FB is pretty fast-paced, there is a risk that you'll have trouble adjusting at first.FB has a lot of custom infrastructure and tools, and prehaps more impressively, it works great. It makes doing your job really great, but on the other hand, you'll end up learning a lot of stuff that won't be a\u2026\u00a0pplicable elsewhere.FB's code-base is very good in some ways, but in other ways, it's not as great as some of the existing engineers think it is. I don't think this is that big of a deal, but the important part is that as an engineer, you need to quickly learn FB's values and practices and \"get with the program\" so to speak. If you don't like some things, then you just have to deal with it, as it's not likely you're going to change people's minds at this point. The nice thing is that things are at least very consistent.",
        "advice": "You need to focus on how you are going to maintain the existing culture and protocols as you grow. I think this could be really tough.",
        "pros": "It might be easy to roll your eyes when people from Facebook say how open their culture is, but it's true; it's more open than any other place I've worked at. At a company wide-level, secret projects, public incidents, important non-public business metrics and the like are all openly discussed. You can ask questions about them directly to Zuckerburg at the weekly Q&A. I think the idea is that if everyone is on th\u2026\u00a0e same page or at least, differing views are heard, the company will be stronger, and solutions may be offered from a place you didn't expect. This is much different from previous companies I worked at, where discussions on internal email lists would be shut down by some lawyer saying that there's certain things that can't be discussed, and important data is divided up to groups and individuals on a \"need to know\" basis, etc.This culture applies at a lower level too. You feel comfortable giving feedback to each other about each other, about product decisions, about management, etc. The flipside of this openness is that you of course, have to be willing to receive the feedback, you have to recognize that while openness and feedback is highly encouraged, decisions have to get made, and actions and data are more valuable than words. At the higher level, since the company trusts employees with access to so much information, keeping such info confidential from the outside world is taken seriously.It's a great place to work as an engineer. You're given a lot of freedom, but it's also a responsibility to make sure you're doing things that are valuable. You don't get much credit for working hard or being smart if you don't produce valuable output.One cool thing about Facebook, in contrast to other comparable companies (Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, though in truth, FB is much smaller), is how they have a pretty singular focus. Even with the differing areas (including advertising and such), they do a good job of keeping their eye on their mission of connecting as many people as possible. I also think they are way more empathetic to their users than most people give them credit for. It seems like popular opinion has it that FB is arrogant and only cares about its users insomuch as they represent $-signs. From within the company, it didn't feel this way at all. I saw a lot of empathy towards users, and a lot effort spent to improve or things or fix broken things with no direct financial benefit. The strategy is not complex. The thinking is that if they can make FB easier and more fun to use, then more people will use it for more time each day (which will also have a network effect of attracting even more people to use it), then the advertising dollars will follow. Of course, it is true that FB wants to make the audience more accessible to advertisers as well, but there are a lot of people at FB who care about privacy and security.They have really good infrastructure and really great ways to share the infrastructure and code. They have a lot of cool internal tools, and what they've built is really impressive, and more importantly, it helps your team build products faster without having to solve problems that someone else already solved. Every software company tries to do this, but FB seems to have been more successful with it. Perhaps it's because they're still relatively small, but if anything, I can at least say it is very cool while it lasts.The perks and work environment are great, unless you're one of those types that can't stand open office spaces. I've worked in both a private office and open offices in multiple companies. While I do think a private office has some benefits, I mostly think it's a personal luxury for the employee and a huge waste of money for the company. I'd much rather have the money go into other areas like salary, benefits, and other workplace improvements rather than the added real estate necessary to have offices.Of course, you've heard about the food and snacks. They have an amazing selection of great stuff, and what I like about it is that it sort of goes above and beyond expectations. Sure, some days, lunch is better than others, but I really can't complain, and the selection of drinks and snacks is amazing. It's not like you should work at FB just because of that, but it demonstrates FB's desire to make work as fun and convenient as possible.You'll be surrounded by people who like being there. I can't think of a better environment to work in. If you have a giant ego, you may not like it as much. Respect is definitely given to those that have deep experience in the industry, and they are expected to lead others and mentor more junior employees. However, if for whatever reason, you can't perform at the level expected, no one is going to care if you did this and that at Google or shipped ten things at MS, etc.FB also has a lot of fun events, and I made a lot of friends working there, so going to the events was fun. Also, if you're older and worried that FB is just a bunch of 22-year-olds, and that you won't fit in, I wouldn't worry about that. FB does have a lot of young employees (who are really smart btw), and it does hire a lot of people straight out of college, but it also attracts a lot of experienced engineers from other top companies like Google, MS, Amazon, etc.Work-life-balance seemed totally normal to me. It may be different depending on your team, but I felt you could do 40-50 hours of work a week for the most part and you would be totally fine. It's about what you produce, not how hard you're working. Other team members who had children would work normal hours and go home at normal times. I didn't see any of these folks have a problem when they left early to take care of their child or things like that. Of course, there could be times that people are expected to work extra if something critical happens, but for the most part everyone wants to avoid this and this happens sparingly, from what I observed. Now, there were many times where I chose to work late myself, but I never felt any pressure to do so. The caveat is that there are on-call rotations, and in addition, even if you are not on-call, you are expected to be reasonably available if the on-call person needs your help. However, again, no one wants this, and your team will work on ways to avoid these situations.The best thing I can say is that working at FB is about productivity. I didn't experience and political bs and it was a pleasure working with a group of people who were all concerned with producing a good product and making the best of the time spent while doing it.",

        "cons": "Facebook still believes that it is a magical meritocracy reasonably free from corporate nonsense. While there aren't any Office Space-style TPS reports to fill out and you don't have to bring in your own coffee and toilet paper, it is now just a big company job like any other. If you want something, whether it be a promotion or a good dessert from the cafeteria, you have to plan how to get it, execute on the plan, an\u2026\u00a0d then make sure everyone else knows what you did and how great it was. You also have to share just enough detail to be convincing but not so much that people can poke holes in your story or usurp your dessert acquisition techniques.The typical first level line manager at Facebook doesn't have prior management experience, only knows the Facebook way of doing things, and is overwhelmed with all the pressure being placed on them. It's a really hard job, too; your manager will be responsible both for setting the direction of your team and for making sure you and your colleagues grow at the company. Most people are not good at either of those things, let alone both. Be aware of what your manager is looking for and how to best communicate it.Everything FB does is subject to a lot of public scrutiny, and you will know how the sausage is made and see that the goals of the company aren't focused on invading privacy or global domination like everyone else thinks. It's hard to see this thing that takes up so much of your life lionized and loathed by the press and your friends.For engineers, a lot of the tools you will use day-to-day are incomplete, broken, poorly documented, and might not be supported anymore. You will get used to this. \"Move fast and break things\" is more complicated than it sounds, and that's really hard to adapt to when coming from a more traditional company. Have big goals but chop them up into small tasks with well-defined success indicators and communicate them early and often.",
        "advice": "To the director- and VP-level people that have been at FB a long time: it's not the same company you went to work at lo those many years ago. There are between 5 and 50 times more employees now, way more products, and way more moving parts. If you want Facebook to stay Facebook-y, invest in the culture that you love. Teach people how to be successful and reward individuals that focus on impact that makes everyone's w\u2026\u00a0ork easier and the product better, not on whatever new hotness made a contrived graph go in the right direction. Lots of things aren't working right anymore and it is up to you to start the hard conversations about which sacred cows can't provide enough milk for tens of thousands of employees because you never taught the new people how to talk about that stuff.",
        "pros": "Facebook is probably the best big company to work for. The company cares a lot about having its employees being productive and satisfied with their jobs and it works hard at maintaining an environment to support that. As a survivor from the real world, this is really rare -- pretty much every company-wide system is designed to make life easier for employees. The benefits and conveniences offered are amazing.M\u2026\u00a0any decisions about the company and its goals are made fairly transparently and open discussion about most things is encouraged. This can get really annoying at times.Unlike most companies, Zuck is actually a pretty inspiring leader. He makes mistakes, but does learn from them. He has really lofty goals, though, and doing the right thing is highly subjective when trying to change the world.If you are politically savvy and willing to work hard and make sure others notice that hard work, you will go far. You will learn a lot if you seek out opportunities to learn, and work with a lot of very talented people. You have to own this yourself, though; don't count on a lot of support.",

        "cons": "There are several. Note that the role specific ones are only for data engineers. What I have found is that there is a lot of difference in the way different groups function, so if you join as a SWE or as a product manager, your experience may be different.1. The work environment is very open and very noisy. There is absolutely no privacy. This becomes more of a bother here because there are so many people now\u2026\u00a0 in all of their buildings. The only time when I was able to do any serious work was when I was working from home.2. As a data engineer, you will be working with a very old version of Hive (0.10 I think). This is the version even before the one with windowing clauses. I was used to working with a better version that also had CBO and I found this limiting. Not only that, if you do this for a year or two you will be at a disadvantage when you switch jobs.3. The data engineers are at the lowest rung of the pecking order. Some call them 2nd tier engineers. I call them data peons. They do not get any say in the kind of work they get to do. Any grunt work can be passed on to you and because of the way the review system works, they can screw you if you show any displeasure. An example of this is the data visualizations. The data engineer is expected to do that. I never had to do that before. So you will be spending a lot of time doing housekeeping work like making sure the pipelines run, making sure the font and color choices you made on the dashboards are pleasing to the analysts who sit on top of you in the pecking order. And to add insult to injury, the visualization tool is a home grown one and none of the skills you get from using it are going to help you in a future job i.e. if you plan to continue doing visualizations.4. Data peons are treated differently as compared to software engineers. Whereas on occasion the software engineers get to work exclusively on different projects for up to a month, there is no such options for data peons. So mobility is very very limited.5. The performance review system is stacked against data peons. Because they are at the lowest rung, most of the people reviewing them are analysts or above. So the analysts are the overlords even when some of them are absolute idiots. The only ones who can survive in this system are ones with a servile attitude and with mediocre talent and ambition.Some of these are because of recent org changes. A lot of the people I know who joined around the same time as me have left the company.",
        "advice": "Even though Mark is one of the most open and humble CEOs I have even worked for, there is a lot of abuse and harassment happening in the lower levels of the Org chart. I think you should listen closely to complaints that are made to the HR and review them.",
        "pros": "The only pros I can think of is not really job related. The Disney like setting is good to bring your kids and family to if they are visiting. But the novelty wears of after 2-3 visits. The summer picnic parties used to be fun before but now it is too crowded and held at cheap locations - like this year it was at one of the piers in SF.As a data engineer you can try to understand the topology of the data systems \u2026\u00a0and see how they work. You can look at the code base and see how they all fit together. See how the log streaming works and how it makes its way into the data storage.

You can message anyone at any time and they will generally get back to you within the hour.- As an intern your opinions and ideas are valued. I came up with my own product and feature ideas on the side, and I was able to implement them and test them publicly.- The company culture is very\u2026\u00a0 open. (Almost) everything at Facebook is no secret - Mark is willing to answer any question you might have about company direction and stance at the weekly Q&As, and at any point you can ask what people are working on, and they're willing to share.- The projects you're able to work on are high impact projects more often than not.- Everyone is passionate about their work and incredibly good at what they do.
