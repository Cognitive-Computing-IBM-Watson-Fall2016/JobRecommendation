        "cons": "Management and communication across departments was not the best. There was a tradition of just moving the most tenured people up to be managers, but they had no prior management experience and there wasn't much training for them. The departments are all silo'd so it's really hard to get anything done cross-departmentally. I would have loved to switch departments internally, but got shut down each time I tried.",
        "advice": "Keep up the good work, David Sacks. The change you have brought to Zenefits is invaluable \u2013\u00a0you're smart, trustworthy and a driven professional. I think the entire company is counting on you to bring Zenefits out on top! Which, by the way, I have no doubt you will be! Just make sure there is communication across departments and keep everybody in the loop so they're constantly reminded what they're working toward\u2026\u00a0s, together!!",
        "pros": "I love Zenefits because of the people you work alongside \u2013\u00a0a whole boatload of young, smart, fun and driven professionals. Half of my friends came from Zenefits. We played pool, ping pong, and foosball together. In sales, you work short days, typically hustling in the mornings but leaving the office around 4:30pm in the afternoon.",

The team I work with is exceptional, full of people that are both intelligent and kind, who are challenge-oriented and care about our projects and one another. I have been a software engineer for 15 years, and have experienced what we all have experienced,\u2026\u00a0 the various joys and frustrations inherent in our business. I have never been happier than I am at eBay, no kidding. Specifics:\u00a0- An internal VM cloud, available for any developer to spin up a machine with a Linux or Windows image to test an idea or develop a POC\u00a0- The freedom to innovate. No one is going to hold you back because \"we don't do things that way around here.\"\u00a0- Compensation is at the top of the scale\u00a0- The culture strikes a great balance between caring about employees and getting the work done. I like working with people who want to work hard, and who understand that living to work is insane.",
